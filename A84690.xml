         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have learned to ſpeak plain truth, without being ſolicitous how it will go off, in this nice and tender Age. Sure I am, that my Maſter will account my Talent not amiſſe beſtowed upon ſuch a ſubject, except for this only, that my heart hath been too little affected with it, or bettered by it, in the ſtudy,
<pb facs="tcp:170084:4"/> and preaching thereof. My hope is by this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, you, and I ſhall (by Gods grace) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it together, and mingle our prayers, that it may mutually do good.</p>
            <p>To you of my <hi>former,</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi> Auditories, I recommend theſe Treatiſes in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeing they are more peculiarly yours; the <hi>one,</hi> (I mean that of <hi>Witney)</hi> becauſe of my unſettlement from <hi>Oxford,</hi> having been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the full hearing of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and heard nothing at all of the <hi>laſt:</hi> The <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> having been from the pulpit made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the whole, and divers of you deſired it from the preſſe. I hope, you will conſider, that the <hi>printed labours</hi> of your Miniſters will not be ſo eaſily accounted for, as the <hi>tranſient breath</hi> of an <hi>uttered Sermon.</hi> That reverend and holy man (my predeceſſour now with God) <hi>Dr. Taylor,</hi> hath charged much upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of you my preſent people, and the whole Town, this way. I fear his workes are in <hi>few</hi> of your <hi>houſes,</hi> and in <hi>fewer</hi> of your <hi>hearts.</hi> It were thirty or forty ſhillings well ſpent (if leſſe will not do it) to buy them, if not into your private families, yet into your ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to be kept among other Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſills, if for no other uſe, yet for a Teſtimony againſt the backſlidings, and fearfull Apoſtacies, of divers of his admirers and followers in the time of his Miniſtry amongst you. And as for me, I know not of what eſteem my poor labours may be to after times. At preſent, I have (with grief of he art I ſpeak it,) cauſe to complain of
<pb facs="tcp:170084:5"/> many of you, that I fear I have ſpent my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain hitherto. It may be, much of the cauſe of it may be from my own ignorance of the moſt proper way of winning upon you: (and I muſt confeſſe, a people, ſo divided, and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, needed a far wiſer man, and more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced then I am to ſoder them together, and beget ſuch an eſteem of my miniſtry in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting parties, as might render it effectual to them:) It may be, I have not ſufficiently wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſeed ſowne with my <hi>prayers</hi> for, and <hi>tears</hi> over you. It may be the many <hi>publique conteſts,</hi> which (God knowes) unwillingly, have diverted my studies, and preaching, too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to controverſies, may be the occaſional cauſe of my too great unſucceſsfulneſſe among you. But however, I pray conſider, I have preached, and now print enough (if you had never heard more from me then theſe Sermons) to render you utterly inexcuſable, if any of you ſtill barre the doors of your hearts with a ſinfull prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truths herein contained. I beſeech you (for Chriſts ſake) let none of you turn them into matter of <hi>diſpute,</hi> if in any thing I differ from any of your judgments. For I know, it is an uſual policy of Satan to make uſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in opinions (though never ſo ſmall, and trivial) as impregnable fortifications againſt the power of truth, when it proceeds from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from whom we differ. I pray remember, that although the matter here treated of according to Chriſtians various experiences, may beget different apprehenſions in ſome things;
<pb facs="tcp:170084:5"/> yet the main ſubſtance of theſe Treatiſes, is of common (and that neceſſary) uſe to all. Let us not loſe that we <hi>agree</hi> in (as to the benefit and uſe of it) whiles we ſtrive for an unprofitable victory in that wherein we <hi>differ.</hi> I have (for the moſt part) avoided (of purpoſe) <hi>peremptory deciſions</hi> in doubtful points, and all <hi>unſavoury reflections</hi> (to my beſt judgment) altogether. I hope you will all make uſe of that wherein all Saints <hi>agree,</hi> and not trouble others with that wherein you <hi>diſagree.</hi> The Lord grant you may, and then I know my preſent labor will not totally be loſt. If but <hi>one</hi> poor ſoul be converted, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, comforted hereby, it will be too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my ſlender pains. However, (becauſe we muſt caſt out the net to catch as <hi>many</hi> fiſhes as we can, though we muſt be contented with <hi>how few ſoever</hi> God ſhall think fit to bring into it) I have thought fit to make way to your acceptance by this <hi>Preface;</hi> and having ſo done, commend it, and you, and this Piece of mine to Gods bleſſing, and intreat you to do the like in your moſt ſolemn Prayers, for</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170084:7"/> ſame I muſt ſay of Divines, they do moſt excel in handling the Doctrines of the Goſpel, who make it their work to joyn the Practical, and the Speculative together. How far this life bloud runs in the veynes of this Treatiſe, wil be eaſily diſcerned by the eye of every one that ſhall pleaſe to take the pains to read it. They who do not before hand ſtomack the Matter and Subject of it, will not (I perſwade my ſelf) be offended with the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling it. The elaborate pains the Authour hath taken in this Work, wherein are many great and precious Truths aſſerted, many knotty points which have not a little puzled the ſpirits of tender Chriſtians, cleared up to their comfort; material Queſtions ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily anſwered, and the ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid open very fully, in reference to the ſtate of Bondage before Converſion, and the ſtate of Adoption after it: and all this and very much more, in a ſolid way both of Scholaſtical and Practical Divinity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve much encouragement from the people of God, for whoſe Souls ſake He hath thus travelled. But there is not any thing of greater provocation to faithful Miniſters of the Word to take paines both by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Writing, then the diligence of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Hearing and Reading. As I ſhall therefore commend this Work to the ſerious peruſal of all, into whoſe hands Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may caſt it; ſo in reference to the ſtudy of it, I Licenſe it for the Preſſe, as that
<pb facs="tcp:170084:7"/> which may tend exceedingly to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Graces, the comfort of afflicted conſciences, the inlightning of the ignorant in points of ſo neceſſary concernment, the conviction of folly in thoſe who preſume of their being in Chriſt before they have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſe of their ſinful and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by nature; and many wayes to the great advantage of all, who have not yet attained to a right underſtanding of theſe Myſteries of Salvation.</p>

               <p n="2">2. This then being the Spirit from whoſe efficiency ariſeth this effect, the <hi>effect</hi> muſt be ſuch as is ſutable to the <hi>cauſe.</hi> The <hi>holy</hi> Spirit of God cannot be ſuppoſed to bring any ſoul into an <hi>unholy</hi> bondage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the condition of ſervitude here ſpoken of, is not ſuch a ſervitude as we before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, a bondage or ſervitude <hi>under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of ſinne; but a bondage or ſervitude under <hi>the guilt</hi> of ſinne: not a bondage <hi>to</hi> ſin, but a bondage <hi>for</hi> ſin: and a bondage, that is the <hi>beginning of liberty from</hi> ſin, That bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is a <hi>voluntary</hi> bondage, a bondage which men are no way ſenſible of, nay they are ſo farre from being ſenſible of it <hi>unto fear</hi> (as the Apoſtle here ſpeaks) that they count it the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170084:13"/> greateſt liberty, and lie under it in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſecurity.</p>
               <p>But this bondage is (naturally) <hi>involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> ſuch as a mans heart is by nature irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileably averſe to, and is therefore wrought in the conſcience, by the mighty convictions of the Spirit of God over-powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by an irreſiſtible, and effectual illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and binding it with the chaines and fetters of that light, under a deep and ſerious conviction of the ſinfulneſſe and miſery of its own condition. It is (in a word) when a ſoul lies under the arreſt of the Spirit, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law to ſeize upon it, and dragg it before the Judgment ſeat of God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to receive its ſentence according to its deſert, <hi>a ſentence of death within it ſelfe</hi> (in the ſame Apoſtles expreſſion, though in another ſenſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9.) upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing whereof, the Law lays heavy fetters and chaines of darkeneſſe upon the ſoul, that keep it <hi>ſhut up to the hope that afterwards</hi> (by the Goſpel) <hi>is revealed.</hi>

                  <hi>of conſcience under which unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſuffer bondage, when the Law chargeth them home with the guilt of ſinne, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of wrath, are</hi> (ordinarily) <hi>the works of Gods bleſſed Spirit.</hi>
               </p>

And therefore we muſt make a diſtinction between the bondage which the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and the bondage which the <hi>wicked ſpirit</hi> brings into, or keeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (therefore) There is a bondage, which admits, and is mitigated by the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>hope of liberty,</hi> and <hi>works towards</hi> a deliverance: and there is a bondage that <hi>excludes all hope and poſſibility</hi> in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a ſinner <hi>of ever being removed.</hi> A bondage in which the chains with which the conſcience is held, and fettered, are of the ſame nature with the Devils, <hi>bonds of death, chains of darkneſſe and deſpaire.</hi> Now ſuch as theſe the holy Spirit knits not (except the deſpair be partial, and bear relation only to humane helps and means of eſcape, and ſuch

In this ſenſe is the Spirit of God ſaid to <hi>ſtrive with</hi> ſinners.

                  <label>Q.</label> But <hi>Sir,</hi> how long will you have us continue under a Spirit of bondage? what meaſures of <hi>humiliation</hi> are requiſite to true <hi>converſion,</hi> and ſound <hi>comfort,</hi> how many years muſt wee <hi>ſerve,</hi> ere you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to <hi>ſet</hi> up?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Truly friends it is paſt my Skill to determine preciſely, neither is it neceſſary I ſhould. The Lord knowes, I could wiſh it were in my power to heal every conſcience the <hi>firſt houre</hi> in which it is ſmitten. But the Lord thinks not fit to deal ſo with many of his Saints; and therefore, I ſay, there is danger leſt wee ſnatch comfort before it is fit for us, or wee for it. And this is all that I deſire to caution you againſt, in this that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170084:23"/> hath been ſaid. But that I may not leave you altogether unſatisfied in this point, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that I may wound no broken ones, I ſhal give you ſome <hi>rules</hi> to judg when God gives you a manumiſſion from the Spirit of bondage, and by that you may gueſſe when you are too haſty.</p>
               <p>1. In generall. As ſoon as the ſoul is brought to <hi>ſee a through neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt, and accordingly to cloſe with him, with true Faith,</hi> it may take comfort. For (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly) to ſuch an one Chriſt belongs. <hi>The waters</hi> belong to <hi>every one that thirſteth,</hi> and they are in a <hi>bleſſed condition that hunger and</hi>

                  <hi>thirſt after righteouſneſſe.</hi> And to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 6</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> belongs, immediatly <hi>comfort</hi> belongs, as he that hath right to an <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> hath right to all the <hi>incomes</hi> of it. Gods Miniſters are bound not to defer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>one minute</hi> from a ſoul, concerning whom they have but ſufficient grounds in charity to believe in Chriſt, <hi>Comfort ye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye my people ſaith the Lord, Iſ</hi> 40. 1. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. the H. Ghoſt tells us that God intends comfort to all that <hi>fly for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As ſoon as I am <hi>within any promiſes reach and compaſſe,</hi> ſo ſoon belongs comfort to mee. And that depends on the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> But will not any troubled ſoul <hi>cry out</hi> for Chriſt, and <hi>lay hold</hi> upon Chriſt in extremity? A <hi>dying</hi> man will never diſpute with himſelf whether he ſhall ſend for a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170084:23"/> a <hi>condemned</hi> man upon the gallows whether he ſhall accept of a <hi>pardon,</hi> and a <hi>drowning</hi> man whether he ſhall ſcramble up a <hi>rock</hi> if it be within his reach. And is every ſuch ſoul fit for comfort?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>2. <hi>A.</hi>
                  </label> I anſwer therefore more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. 1. I ought not to <hi>refuſe comfort,</hi> when I find my ſoul <hi>weary of the bonds and fetters of ſin; as much or more then of the fetters of trouble and anguiſh for ſinne.</hi> Beloved, when the <hi>chains of corruption</hi> are as grievous, as <hi>pangs of conſcience;</hi> when I hate Satan as a <hi>tempter,</hi> as much as I hate him as a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler;</hi> when I groan as much to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the <hi>body of death</hi> as from <hi>the weight of wrath,</hi> then I am ripe for comfort. But <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24</note> when I hear my heart cry louder, <hi>Oh my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and <hi>oh, my grief;</hi> then <hi>oh, my ſinne,</hi> and <hi>oh, my guilt;</hi> when it follows God and Means with <hi>oh, give me comfort;</hi> and never, with <hi>oh, give me grace;</hi> when it cryes, <hi>oh, that I had peace,</hi> and cryes not, Oh that I had <hi>holineſſe,</hi> this ſoul is not ripe for comfort. Comfort would undo that ſoul.</p>
               <p>2. I ought not to <hi>refuſe comfort,</hi> when I can be <hi>contented to take Chriſt upon his own termes, to teach, and rule, as well as redeem and ſave my ſoul.</hi> When I can freely deny, reſigne, part with every thing <hi>for him,</hi> can give up my ſelf to be made any thing <hi>by him,</hi> when I value Chriſt ſo as that I will not entertain any thing a minute longer, though it bee never ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170084:24"/> dear to me, that diſpleaſeth him, even my deareſt luſt, my greateſt profit, my entireſt friends, my fulleſt comforts. For then I am emptyed of ſelf, and hungry after Chriſt, and ſo fall under the promiſe, he <hi>filleth the hungry with good things.</hi> But when I am diſpoſed only to take Chriſt <hi>partially,</hi> cling <note place="margin">Luke 1. 53.</note> about the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of Chriſt, but hang looſe from the yoke of Chriſt; when my <hi>mouth</hi> is <hi>open</hi> to Chriſt, but my <hi>ear ſhut,</hi> this is ſad. When I drive the bargain for Chriſt to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and half pence, <hi>(the Lord bee graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me in this one thing, &amp;c.)</hi> Comfort to me (in ſuch a condition) is bane. See how the Apoſtle joynes <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. how Chriſt joines a promiſe of eaſe and layes on his yoke at once, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>3. Then I am fit for comfort when I can be <hi>contented if God ſee fit and needfull for me, to be longer without it;</hi> when I can in the ſincerity of my heart pray, <hi>Lord, if my rotten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>comfort longer:</hi> here is a ſoul that (if any) is ripe for comfort. But till a man come to this frame, it is a ſigne hee is not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken, his bondage hath not tamed him enough, and therefore comfort to this man would be like <hi>raw meat,</hi> it would never digeſt with him, the Lord hath not yet gotten the abſolute maſtery over, and poſſeſſion of his will, and therefore no wonder if he lay <hi>more Irons</hi> upon him. Some parents will not give their children any thing of that diſh that they impatiently cry for; and (they ſay) our Biſhops were not to be admitted, till they three times refuſed it. I am ſure <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was not long kept out of his kingdome when hee had profeſſed an indifferency to keep or loſe it as the Lord ſaw moſt fit. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25. And (obſerve the Lords uſual dealings with his people) he ſeldome gives any comfort when men <hi>muſt have</hi> it, or there is no quiet with them; what ever grace they have, or luſt they maſter by the continuance of ſoul troubles, they muſt have comfort, or elſe (in <hi>Hamans</hi> unthankfull ſtrain) they cry, <hi>All this availeth me nothing.</hi> And if perſons <note place="margin">Ruth 5. 13.</note> of ſuch impatient ſpirits get comfort under that diſpoſition &amp; temper of ſoul, 'tis as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> became a mother by importunity, but died in child-birth with <hi>Benjamin.</hi> So do ſuch oftentimes undo themſelves with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which their importunity haſtened to them.</p>
               <p>More of this kind might be added, but I

Iſ</hi> 61. 1. 2, 3. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me to proclaim liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the capives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound &amp;c.</hi> Friends, I ſpeak not theſe things to diſſuade you from the <hi>uſe</hi> of ſuch means, onely to warn you that you lay not the ſtreſſe of your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon means, but rather that you uſe them, in dependance upon, and with addreſſes to the Spirit to make them effectuall. For my part, I ſuſpect that peace and comfort which <hi>comes in</hi> a groſſe neglect and contempt of Ordinances and Duties, or is <hi>attended with it.</hi> I doubt, ſuch perſons get out of priſon by a <hi>falſe key,</hi> the devill can <hi>pick the lock</hi> and let out the Spirits priſoners, he can <hi>file off</hi> their <hi>chaines,</hi> and ſet them free from trouble; but they had better have kept in <hi>priſon,</hi> then have been beholden to him for their <hi>liberty,</hi> when men are delivered from a <hi>conſcientious bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> to an <hi>unconſcionable liberty,</hi> they had need pray to God to <hi>free</hi> them from that <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> This I ſpeak to prevent a miſtake of my drift in this uſe. To returne to what I intend. Beloved, if the Spirit have brought you under bondage, apply your ſelves to him
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170084:26"/> that he will accompliſh his end in your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that he will manage them to the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your proud hearts, to the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh, that your ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Let this <hi>convince</hi> us that the miniſtery of the Goſpel excludes not the preaching of the Law as inſtrumentall to converſion. I know the Law <hi>alone</hi> converts no man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Spirit of Bondage; yet it <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way of the Lord,</hi> the Spirit working thereby, to <hi>levell high thoughs, &amp;c. that</hi> lift themſelves up againſt Chriſt. Miniſters are the Servants of the Spirit and muſt ſerve the ſpirits deſignes, in <hi>Law</hi> as wel as <hi>Goſpel.</hi> What would men have us do? Shall we ſpeak peace to thoſe to whom the Spirit denounceth open war? How ſhall we keep to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, if in ſtead of <hi>binding on earth,</hi> thoſe who are <hi>bound in heaven,</hi> we let them <hi>looſe</hi> and help them to <hi>eſcape;</hi> preach doctrines of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Redemption, and Salvation, and teach them how to apply generall Goſpell truths to harden their ſouls in ſin? Mee thinks I hear the Lord when he gives a Miniſter his charge, ſpeak in the language of <hi>Jehu,</hi> when he had ſhut up <hi>Baals</hi> worſhippers in a guard; <hi>If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands eſcape, he that letteth him go, his life ſhal be for the life of him.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 24. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his own words to the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>When I ſay, &amp;c.</hi> Yet I muſt tell you, I would have the Law preached as it is in the <hi>hands of Chriſt,</hi> i. e. not as caſting men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170084:26"/> under an irrecoverable condemnation for every offence, not as exacting rigorouſly every punctilio of a duty, under pain of being rejected by God, not as requiring obedience as a condition of a covenant of works to ſalvation. Although it be neceſſary too, that as a Covenant of works it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to thoſe that are <hi>under the Law,</hi> that by the ſight of it, they may be made to fly to the Goſpel, as a <hi>Map</hi> diſcovers rocks and quickſands that men may avoid them; and Phyſick books, poiſons, to warn men of them. By preaching it as in <hi>the hands of Chriſt,</hi> I mean wee muſt withall open a door of hope, ſhew them Chriſt as the end of the Law, to whom all the preaching of the Law aymes.</p>
               <p>For my part, I meet with a dictinction of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Law as in the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as in the hands of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I think, as 'tis ordinarily taken, it is grounded on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Socinianiſme, that the Spirit was not a ſpirit of Adoption under the old Teſtament.</hi> But I can allow the expreſſion in this ſenſe. Goſpell muſt bee held forth more clearly now then it was then, and believing more urged then doing, and doing in a way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. God giving them a yoke of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances which vailed the Spirit, and looked much like a Covenant of works, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell are to take off that vail, and ſhew Chriſts open face.</p>
               <p>3. Let this <hi>plead</hi> a little for poor <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirits,</hi> to Miniſters and friends that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170084:27"/> take paines to comfort them. When we ſpeak comfort to them, and their ſouls <hi>refuſe it,</hi> as <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſ. 77. 2. We are apt to cenſure them for peeviſh, and perverſe, &amp;c. But friends, is this reaſonable, to charge a priſoner with peeviſhneſſe, becauſe he doth not <hi>ſhake off his bolts,</hi> and come forth without the <hi>keepers leave?</hi> I know ſometimes there is much fault in ſuch ſouls, but the ſpirit works with their weakneſſe to withhold comfort; and though they be blameable for refuſing it, yet the ſpirit orders their weakeneſſes therein to his bleſſed ends. Wherfore, if you chide them for ſhutting the doors upon themſelves, do it ſo, as withall to pray the Spirit to open them, elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open them, if they would never ſo fain. And thoſe of us who were once in their condition were as untoward as they, till Gods Spirit opened our eyes to ſee a well of conſolation.</p>
               <p>4. Let this <hi>humble us</hi> all who have <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> any of <hi>the powers of the World to come,</hi> and <hi>been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> this way, for our often <hi>grievings</hi> and <hi>vexings</hi> of the H. Spirit; That we have ſtouted it out againſt the Spirits <hi>arreſts,</hi> and refuſed to bee his <hi>priſoners.</hi> If this were <hi>wilfully done,</hi> O how evill a thing was it, how high a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation! If a warrant from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the hands of a Bayliffe will make a man ſtand and render himſelf priſoner. How dares any man make an eſcape when the word arreſts

Yet is it not the bare word that can work it; no, though we concur to it, and labour by meditation, conference, and other means to do it; for when we have done all, <hi>We receive it,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>
               <p>If you ask, <hi>What word</hi> doth the Spirit work this bondage by?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, By the <hi>Law</hi> (generally and principally) though ſome <hi>Goſpel-conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may ſometimes be admitted to <hi>whet</hi> and <hi>ſharpen</hi> the edge of the Law. I mean, the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, which aggravates that bondage, by <hi>exemplifying</hi> the miſery of being under the curſe of the Law, the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerableneſſe of lying under the wrath of God, in the perſon of Chriſt, barely ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for imputed ſin; by diſcovering a rich and unvaluable Treaſure, and ſpreading all the glory of it before a man who muſt not lay hands on one farthing token of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170084:33"/>
               <p>But the Goſpel concurs only <hi>per accidens;</hi> as the ſight of <hi>Lazarus in heaven,</hi> increaſed the <hi>hell of Dives,</hi> and the <hi>plenty in the gates of Samaria,</hi> that Princes miſery who was to <hi>dye without taſting of it,</hi> 2 Kings 7. 19. But I ſay, The <hi>Law</hi> is the proper and ordinary inſtrument of the Spirit in this work. It is the <hi>School-maſter,</hi> whoſe laſh makes ſinners backs ſmart. Gal. 3. 24. <hi>which convinceth men as tranſgreſſors,</hi> James 2. 9. <hi>Cauſeth the knowledg of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. <hi>Worketh wrath;</hi> i. e. <hi>manifeſts it, worketh the ſenſe of it into the ſoule,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. <hi>Maketh the offences of ſinners to abound,</hi> diſcovers millions of ſins more then he dreamed of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens ſin</hi> in the conſcience, and puts a weapon into its hand, to <hi>kill</hi> the ſinner under its guilt, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 9. It is therefore called by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56. <hi>The ſtrength of ſin; i. e.</hi> that which onely armes ſin with terrour, and makes its guilt an intolerable guilt.</p>
               <p>The Spirit <hi>interprets the Law</hi> to a mans conſcience, and armes it with its <hi>curſe</hi> to pronounce againſt every ſin; and this Law thus armed, <hi>arreſts,</hi> and <hi>endites,</hi> and <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> and <hi>convicteth,</hi> and <hi>condemneth</hi> the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and when it hath done ſo, it ſtops there, it is fain to do as <hi>Felix</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>leave him bound,</hi> without any mitigation <note place="margin">Acts 24. 27.</note> or qualification of his miſery, till the ſame Spirit, whoſe ſervant the Law is, be pleaſed to <hi>let him free.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> 3. BUT how appeares it that the Spirit of God ordinarily works firſt this way?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſ.</label> 1. Becauſe the Spirit of God (as to the order and manner of his working) deals not with man, as we uſe to do with <hi>ſtocks</hi> and <hi>ſtones;</hi> (We tranſlate them from place to place, and condition to condition, barely by an act of <hi>extrinſecal power;</hi> As we do raiſe a ſtone to the top of a ſteeple, and prop him up there contrary to its Natural inclination, which tends another way:) but as we do with living Creatures when we uſe ſuch means to ſtoop them to our deſignes as their natures require. Thus we make advantage of the <hi>hunger of the Hawk</hi> to tempt him to the fiſt, and of the <hi>fiſh</hi> to bring him to the hook, and <hi>watch</hi> wild creatures, that out of <hi>need of reſt</hi> we may make them content to become tame and tractable.</p>
               <p>And thus doth the Spirit deal with men.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170084:34"/> Their <hi>intellectual</hi> natures are moved to <hi>higher objects,</hi> but in the ſame way by making uſe of <hi>emptineſs</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi> to work upon the moving powers of the ſoul, and carry them out towards an object that will ſatisfie. For certainly (though I am aſſured that <hi>moral perſwaſion</hi> is not ſufficient to convert with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſupernatural infuſion of perſwaſible faculties, wherein I ſtand at profeſſed defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Papiſt and Arminian: yet) this ſupernatual work is not ordained to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the converſion of any ſinner, he <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing meerly paſſive</hi> all the while; for then a man would be ſaved by meer <hi>force,</hi> and faith as the condition applying the Covenant of Grace (which implies knowledg and choice) were utterly uſeleſſe, and ſo might innocently be denyed by the Antinomians. The Spirit therefore <hi>infuſeth new power</hi> into the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and then <hi>ſets them on working</hi> after ſpiritual objects in an order ſutable to their nature.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay, There is nothing more <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> and yet nothing more <hi>Natural</hi> in the world, then ſound converſion. It is <hi>ſupernatural</hi> in its <hi>power</hi> and <hi>principle,</hi> it is moſt <hi>natural</hi> in its <hi>manner, method</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> God doth not <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but <hi>renew</hi> our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in converſion, and when <hi>renewed,</hi> makes uſe of them without any <hi>violence</hi> in the moſt natural way.</p>
               <p>And therefore, though he renew the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> to apprehend, and the <hi>Will</hi> to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170084:34"/> chooſe, and the <hi>Affections</hi> to purſue heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects, which of themſelves they had no power at all to do; yet he doth not <hi>invert</hi> their uſual <hi>order</hi> of working upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo (by conſequence) that <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming light</hi> which (from heaven) ſwayes the laſt dictate of the <hi>practical underſtanding,</hi> where the Work of Grace begins, ſo renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind effectually, works upon the <hi>will,</hi> enabled (at the ſame inſtant) to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and that (in like manner) ſtirs the <hi>affections</hi> (at the ſame moment) made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile and obedient to the <hi>Law of the mind.</hi> So then, the <hi>root</hi> of this <hi>tree of Life</hi> lies in the <hi>mighty power of God,</hi> in changing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the <hi>Judgment.</hi> And that (therefore) muſt <hi>firſt</hi> be brought, to paſſe a <hi>right ſentence</hi> on its own condition, and the condition to which it is called, that ſo the <hi>will</hi> may not make a blind fortuitous choice when it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſt and ſalvation. Now can you perſwade a man that <hi>Phyſick</hi> is good for him, except you firſt convince him that he is <hi>ſick?</hi> Can you perſwade a man that feels <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 22</note> no <hi>fetters</hi> to cry out for <hi>liberty;</hi> a man that thinks he is in the <hi>beſt</hi> way, to take <hi>anothers?</hi> Can you poſſibly make a man apply himſelfe to <hi>one only</hi> Phyſician to cure him, and give him any thing that he will ask (yea, if he ask a mans whole eſtate,) when there are <hi>many</hi> that profeſſe to be able to do the cure, and profer their ſervice at an eaſier rate; except you can poſſeſſe him ſtrongly that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170084:35"/> all theſe be <hi>Mountabanks,</hi> and he muſt go to that <hi>one</hi> if ever he meanes to be cured? The poor woman never ſought to Chriſt for her <hi>Flux,</hi> till ſhe had found all other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians had emptied her <hi>purſe</hi> of its coyne, but could not her <hi>body</hi> of its <hi>diſtemper, Luke</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 43.</p>
               <p>2. It is the uſual way of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, nay, the way of Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, in their Labours and Endeavours for converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners. Certainly the method of the Spirit in working converſion, is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which God will have his Miniſters walk in, and which Chriſt himſelf hath thought fit to tread in to that end. Now this I hope to clear by abundance of inſtances. The Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (who was not only a Law giver, but a Typical Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo his Miniſtry was the Miniſtry of Chriſt) was in this method; firſt he layes downe the <hi>Moral Law</hi> for conviction, and ratifies it with a curſe, as the proper ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient into that cup of trembling, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to unconverted ſinners: and then ſuppoſing its work to be done, preacheth Chriſt in the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedy for ſuch a malady. Downwards obſerve the method of the <hi>Prophets, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> all their Prophecies are by the Holy Spirit caſt into this order. How ſeverely doth <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for five or ſix of the firſt Chapters, convince, reprove,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170084:35"/> threaten the rebellious people for their ſins; and thoſe precious <hi>Evangelical comforts</hi> of which he (of all the Prophets) is moſt full, are caſt off to the <hi>latter part</hi> of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> commiſſion is firſt to <hi>root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy, and to throw down</hi> obſtinate and unconverted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and then to <hi>build and to plant,</hi> chap. 1. 10. And (as that people were an obſtinate and ſtiff-necked people) ſee how he handles them with reproofs, convictions, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings for above twenty Chapters together, before he is commiſſioned to ſpeak any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of comfort to them. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> commiſſion alſo is full of <hi>Lamentations, and mourning, and woe, a bitter Roll,</hi> chap. 2. 10. and 3. 1. &amp;c. and for thirty Chapters downeward we find little elſe but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that <hi>Roll,</hi> ſcarce a duſt of ſugar to ſweeten the Pill. <hi>Hoſea</hi> is to pronounce the people <hi>Lo-ruhamah</hi> and <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> a people that have <hi>not obtained mercy,</hi> that were <hi>none of Gods people,</hi> ere he is to adminiſter one dram of comfort, and that which he doth, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. it is conditioned with threatnings of ſevere afflictions and judgments for ſin. <hi>Joel</hi> and the reſt are generally in the ſame ſtrain. I grant, the order of the Prophecies doth not neceſſarily imply they were uttered in the ſame manner as they are written; yet ſeeing the Spirit of God who directed the Pen-men as well as the Speakers, thinks fit ſo to diſpoſe them, it ſeems likely he did it for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170084:36"/> ſome ſuch uſe, as we have obſerved</p>
               <p>But theſe may to ſome ſeem <hi>Legal Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> let us therefore ſee how our Saviour and <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles beſtir themſelves in their Miniſtry. The firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that our Saviour preacheth is, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand,</hi> Mark 1. 15. And in the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh of <hi>Matthew,</hi> how ſevere an Interpreter of the Law, how effectual a convincer of ſin, how rigorous a Pronouncer of Judgement and Condemnation upon ſinners, doth he ſhew himſelfe? And how many woes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon all occaſions doth he denounce? <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> convinceth the Scribes and Phariſees of their <hi>viperous hearts,</hi> and <hi>vaine confidences,</hi> and threatens them with <hi>wrath to come, layes the axe to the root</hi> of all their hopes, &amp; ſcorcheth their conſciences with the flames of <hi>unquenchable fire, Matth.</hi> 37, 9, 10, 12. The Apoſtles alſo follow the ſame method. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. and <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 17. and 24 make it their firſt work to preach the Law, and Judgment. So that it ſeemes needleſſe to me to inſiſt any longer on this head.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Examples</hi> of thoſe Converts, the manner of whoſe converſion is declared in the Scripture, hold forth a farther evidence to this Truth. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ſo converted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>Smites on the thigh; Manaſſeh</hi> is humbled greatly, and the Crucifiers of our Saviour are <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> Acts <note place="margin">2 Chro. 33. 12</note>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:170084:36"/> 2. 37. and the Jailor <hi>comes in trembling,</hi> chap. 16. 29. <hi>Paul is ſmitten to the ground,</hi> Acts 9. 4. and <hi>trembles and is aſtoniſhed,</hi> verſe 6. And the inceſtuous Corinthian is <hi>even ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of ſorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 7. And if any examples, (as thoſe of <hi>Zacheus</hi> and <hi>Lydia)</hi> ſeem to ſpeak no ſuch matter, yet ſeeing the Scriptures are not ſo punctual in the <hi>manner,</hi> but only relate the <hi>matter,</hi> they muſt rather be rdeuced to this rule, then be urged as examples againſt it. Sure, if God had dealt with them another way, and would have had us to have made any ſuch exceptions from the general rule of his dealing with others, he would have been more particular in the recording of thoſe paſſages that might ground them. Beſides, it is concieved by ſome of no mean note, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted before, as members of the Jewiſh Church, and their then converſion was but to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which needed no ſuch work. As for <hi>Lydia,</hi> 'tis clear ſhe was one that before was a Proſelyte, one that worſhipped God, the Text ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> 4. WHy will the Spirit work this way?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> For ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby is <hi>Chriſt made far more precious then he would be, if he dropt this grace into our mouthes without any ſuch ſharpning our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites by the pain of hunger and want, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</hi> The <hi>full ſoul loatheth</hi> (or as it is in the Original) <hi>treadeth under foot the honey comb,</hi> Prov. 27. 7. The <hi>whole</hi> will think a fee loſt upon a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and the man on whom the Law hath not paſſed, will not ſay <hi>Gramercy</hi> for a <hi>pardon.</hi> And on the other ſide, it is <hi>neceſſity</hi> that endears any thing to us. And the more extreme that neceſſity is, the more welcome is the ſupply. A beggar that is pinched with hunger, and even ſtarved with cold, what courſe fare, and thread bare garments will he beg hard
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170084:37"/> for? A man upon the Gallowes, and ready to be turned off, what will he give for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Sharking Tradeſmen know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what uſe to make of the buyers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to enhance the price. A man will huck, and drive the bargain for Chriſt to half pence and farthings till he be brought to this paſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby doth God <hi>engage the hearts of men more to him.</hi> Look over the thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrances of Gods Saints over all the Word, and ſee how great an ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent their <hi>miſery</hi> is into their <hi>thankfulneſs. Ezra, We were bond-men, yet our God hath not forſaken us in our Bondage, &amp;c.</hi> Ezra 9. 9 <hi>David</hi> frequently enlargeth upon this common place, <hi>Pſal</hi> 18. 5, 6, 7. <hi>The cords of hell compaſſed me about, and the ſnares of death prevented me. In my diſtreſs I cryed upon the Lord, and he heard my voice,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>The ſorrowes of death compaſſed me, and the pains of hell gate hold upon me. Then called I on the name of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And after followes a thankful enquiry, <hi>Quid retribuam? What ſhall I render to the Lord? q. d.</hi> I do not know any return in the world that may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſo great a mercy. So <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 38. 20. after his ſad complaint wherein he drawes a picture of his ſad condition in all the ſaddeſt and darkeſt colours imaginable, at laſt ſaith he, <hi>The Lord was ready to ſave me, therefore will I ſing my ſongs to the ſtringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments all my life long in the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:170084:38"/>
               <p>Think how thankful a <hi>ſtarving begger</hi> will be for an <hi>Almes,</hi> a <hi>condemned</hi> man for a <hi>Pardon,</hi> a <hi>Priſoner</hi> in <hi>Argier</hi> for a <hi>Ranſom,</hi> a man that roars under the <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Collick,</hi> for a cure; and (in ſome ſort) you conceive how engaging ſuch a mercy as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Redemption, Healing is to a ſinner bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, weary, laden with the weight of his ſins, terrified, afrighted, diſtracted with the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure for them; to hear of a Saviour, a Redeemer, a Comforter, how welcome is it? How <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 15, 16 <hi>I was a Perſecutor, a Blaſphemer, injurious, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love,</hi> in ſuch a ſoul, <hi>will keep even pace with thankfulneſs.</hi> Undoubtedly the more low the Spirit ſinks us in this dungeon, the more low thoughts will men have of themſelves, and by conſequence, the more love will they ſhew to Chriſt, who even in ſuch a condition did not abhor them, but took them out of ſuch a condition to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them unto the neereſt friendſhip with himſelfe. For a Prince to take a condemned Malefactor from the Priſon or Gallowes, and advance her to his Bed and Throne, how endearing a love would this bee? how every way free, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, unexpected, unconceived, muſt it appear? This is evident in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compared with their following Verſes.</p>

Friends, forbear to preſſe me any longer. Had you felt thoſe heart aches, and cramps, thoſe agues and convulſions of conſcience which I have done for ſuch courſes as thoſe; had you been in the Spirits houſe of Bondage as I have been, had you been ſtretched upon the Spirits rack, had you felt the ſtrappado of the Law, and hady our bones broken on its wheele; had you fed upon aſhes, and drunk tears and been whipt</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall eaſily grant that the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> is a very effectual, and the moſt effectual reſtraint to ſinne when it is manifeſted to the ſoul, and ſet home effectually by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but ſo dull are we to improve ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous inducements, that we have but too much need of experience of the <hi>bitterneſſe of ſinne,</hi> to ſecond that conſideration. And indeed, though that be moſt effectual where it works, yet this is effectual with the moſt. And moreover (as before was ſhewed) the argument from love is ſtrengthened by this experience.

And this works often more effectually by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their lives who are made the butts of theſe divine arrowes, with their own; when they conſider that if others ſmart ſo heavily for the fewer and ſmaller ſins which they (to appearance) are guilty of, their own more and greater deſerve worſe.</p>

               <p>Jeſus Chriſt upon earth, when he ſuffered for our ſinnes, was under a <hi>Spirit of Bondage:</hi> The Law ſaid to him when he ſtood in our ſtead, <hi>whoever is under the Law is under the curſe of God, and under the ſentence of eternal death: but thou art under the Law.</hi> And this had the ſame effects which it hath on us, it wrought <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>anguiſh,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>deſpair</hi> of help every way but from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that was able to deliver him from death;</hi> and that made him powre out <hi>ſtrong cries and groanes.</hi> Heb. 5. 7.</p>

               </p>

               <p>God will have <hi>heart anſwer heart, as face, face.</hi> Were ſuch works not uſual, even <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 19</note> Saints would look upon ſuch as <hi>Monſters</hi> whom the <hi>hand of the Lord hath ſmitten.</hi> Chriſt was ſo ſtared on as a Monſter, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. 17. <hi>They look and ſtare upon me.</hi> And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Behold I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for ſignes and wonders.</hi> As the World looks upon troubled ſpirits, ſo would other Saints, but for this experience.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> 5 VVHat meaſure doth the Spirit work by in this bringing ſouls under bondage?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> He obſerves not the <hi>ſame meaſure</hi> with every ſoul, nor continues it ſo long on <hi>one</hi> ſoul as on <hi>another.</hi> Only ſo much muſt be wrought of all the forementioned works, as will accompliſh the ſaving ends of thoſe works. Now the end of <hi>one</hi> of theſe works is the begetting of the <hi>other,</hi> and the end of <hi>all</hi> Chriſt. Chriſt is the <hi>end of the Law</hi> to a <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4</note> Believer, as ſoon as a man is brought to a full cloſe with Chriſt, the works mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are at an end, and ſo they will when they have done the immediate <hi>preparatory work to faith,</hi> which is to drive the ſoul out of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhelters, and make it conclude it ſelf under a neceſſity of coming to Chriſt. So much <hi>conviction</hi> (ſaith a godly and a learned man now with God) is neceſſary as breeds <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Shepherds</hi> Sound Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> 
                  <hi>compunction,</hi> and ſo much <hi>compunction</hi> as breeds a through <hi>Humiliation.</hi> And when
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170084:41"/> is that? When the ſoul thinks no more of by-wayes to eſcape, but accepts the bonds, and kiſſeth the fetters of the Spirit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth its impriſonment juſt, and that juſtice might without any wrong done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it to perpetual impriſonment. Theſe are wrought generally in all Converts, but not in al ſo viſibly, nor do the Converts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alike long ſtay in one as the other; ſome have leſſe horror and anguiſh, yet perhaps a more kindly ſelf-denying, ſoul-humbling, ſelf deſpair; ſome ſtay longer in this, and ſome in that work. As in the way to <hi>London,</hi> every man paſſeth through the <hi>ſame Stages,</hi> but every man doth not <hi>ſtay</hi> as long at, or <hi>take</hi> as much <hi>notice</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Stage as another may: one quick Gallopper, and luſty young man well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will ride through in a day, and perhaps only call at every Town for a cup of drink; another of flower conſtitution of body, and with worſe accommodations can ſcarce tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel twenty miles a day, and ſo makes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger work of it. But all that go the right way, go through them all; and if perhaps God may be ſuppoſed to lead any ſoul a <hi>ſhorter cut,</hi> and help him to paſſe beſide ſome of them; it is by a private way that he only knowes and can direct in. <hi>His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters know no other, and therefore we muſt direct you in the beaten rode.</hi> Yet becauſe the Lord doth make a difference betweene ſins and ſinners, he doth ordinarily alſo proportion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170084:42"/> this work of humiliation and bondage to them and their ſins. And indeed, were the ordinary way to peace and comfort no more difficult from one ſin then from another; men would thence have a great ground to embolden themſelves to the indifferent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of greater and leſſe ſins. As good be whipped for ſomething as nothing, (ſay untoward Scholars) for a great matter as for a ſmall. Therefore if a ſinner hath ſinned with an high hand againſt God, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his own conſcience, and had a more then ordinary influence upon the ſins of others; when ſins have been aggravated by abundance of patience, of means, of mercies, of Judgments, of vowes, and reſolutions, and (by conſequence) of Apoſtaſies; this man muſt look for more ſorrowes. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 4.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. An Objection anſwered from Chriſts Invitation of ſinners unto him, without requiring ſuch conditions as neceſſary to their admiſsion.</head>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj</label> You ſeem by what is ſaid hitherto to <hi>drive ſome from Chriſt,</hi> at leaſt for ſuch or ſuch a ſpace of time, until they be humbled and broken ſufficiently. Whereas Chriſt invites <hi>Whoſoever will to come</hi> unto him, and no where qualifies his acceptance of him by ſuch conditions, [Provided, <hi>That no ſinner that comes under ſuch and ſuch a guilt lay hold on me, without ſuch preparative mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Spirit of Bondage.]</hi> And how then can you warrant that which hath been ſaid in this point?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> I anſwer, 'Twere pity but that Miniſters tongue ſhould <hi>cleave to the roof of his mouth,</hi> that forbids any to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt whom Chriſt <hi>calls.</hi> But you ſhall ſee, that Chriſt, though he call all ſinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 22. 17. yet he calls them under the qualifications of <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>thirſty</hi> ſouls, Iſai. 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come</hi>

                  <hi>ye to the waters; he requires not money, but he requires thirſt.</hi> He requires nothing to <hi>move him to give,</hi> but ſomething to <hi>qualifie and diſpoſe us to receive.</hi> And looks that they be <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. elſe they will not value, and he knowes they will not value <hi>his reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not bid men ſtay from Chriſt til they have ſuch qualifications, but I invite them rather to ſeek thoſe qualifications from Chriſt, which fit them for him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot ſavingly come to him.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall give yet a more <hi>diſtinct</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Chriſt therefore to whom ſinners are invited to come, is an <hi>univerſal good,</hi> and therefore there is in him a confluence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things. Now as in a <hi>publick Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine</hi> every man may have free acceſſe to call for what is proper for him, but every man may not be admitted to every thing there, but only ſome few who are priviledged by their condition and relations to the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and are able to manage the whole for their own private good and the publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. So in <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi> and <hi>Rewards.</hi> Now though every man be invited to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet every one that is called may not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to finger <hi>all</hi> theſe precious commodities, but ſuch only as his condition is capable of, and at preſent moſt needs. So a ſoul under
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170084:44"/> the <hi>power of ſin,</hi> is invited preſently, even the next moment to come to Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his yoak; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſubmit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yeild up himſelfe to be ſaved in his way, and in order thereunto to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon abſolute Promiſes of the firſt grace, by prayer, and waiting for power ſo to do. He calls ſinners, to what? to <hi>Repentance, Luke</hi> 5. 32. and penitents to <hi>reſt, Matth.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
               <p>But to thoſe <hi>other advantages</hi> which are offered to ſinners in Chriſt, no ſinner is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>as a ſinner;</hi> but to ſome as an humbled contrite ſinner, to others, as a renewed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner. <hi>Thoſe whom God calls, them he juſtifies, and whom he juſtifies, them he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies,</hi> Rom 8. 30 He calls ſinners, juſtifies when called, glorifies when juſtified. For the application of the <hi>Merit</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>Juſtification</hi> thereby, preſuppoſeth the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of the Law to have paſſed upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon to whom it is due, and that not only in the ſentence of the <hi>Law</hi> and Court of <hi>God,</hi> but in the ſentence of the <hi>heart</hi> and Court of <hi>Conſcience</hi> alſo Thence the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Phariſee and the Publican in point of divine Juſtification is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture attributed to the ſelf-juſtification of the one, and ſelf condemation of the other; not to the <hi>procuring cauſes,</hi> but the <hi>diſpoſing qualifications, Luke</hi> 18. 14. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that whiles the Jewes went about to make their own <hi>righteouſneſſe by the</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:170084:45"/> 
                  <hi>Law to ſtand,</hi> they failed of Juſtification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that kept them from <hi>ſubmitting to the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. And as for <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> they preſuppoſe <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and (by conſequence) ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a ſpirit of bondage. For <hi>peace with God,</hi> and <hi>joy and comfort in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> follow Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Thus then (to apply althat hath been ſaid:) If what hath been before ſaid, ſeem too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to knock any of thoſe upon the fingers who lay hold on Chriſt, know it is only the <hi>preſumptuous ſinner</hi> who is thus handled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he layes not hold on that in Chriſt, which he regularly ought to come to him for; and faſtens upon that which (in the condition wherein he ſtands, and under the diſpoſition and frame of ſpirit which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſeth him) belongs not to him. And herein Miniſters are no way blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. As if a great Prince proclaim a free grant of ſome eſpecial bounty or favour to all that will receive it; ſuppoſe pardon and liberty to a thouſand Malefactors, and that without any conſideration of any thing to be given or performed by them, only (becauſe he will have them ſenſible of his goodneſſe therein, and warned from ſuch courſes for the future) he reſolves they ſhal al be brought to the trial of the Law, and abide its ſentence, and receive their pardon upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, at the very in ment in which the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170084:45"/> is turning, or the cart driving away; and then alſo not without acceptance of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch termes, and conditions to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſigned. If now a rabble of Theeves or Murtherers, that fear the Law will one day overtake them, and therefore are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſecure themſelves for time paſt, and to fortifie themſelves againſt Juſtice in the practice of the ſame villaines for time to come, ſhall rudely intrude and challenge the benefit of the Princes free Pardon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch formalities as are before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; are they to be blamed who are but the inſtruments for the diſtributing of theſe pardons, if they bid them ſtand off, yea, and knock off their fingers, if they ſhall lay hold upon them in ſuch a diſorderly way? This is the caſe of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt now adayes. A company of brazen-faced, preſumptuous <hi>Intruders,</hi> make a tumult and arrogate to themſelves and their complices, the <hi>name of Saints,</hi> and challenge an intereſt in Chriſts pardons, priviledges, and comforts, in a way quite inconſiſtent with the ſtanding rule of the Word, and the conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of all that are Saints indeed. And becauſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel will not betray their truſt, and let go the pardons and priviledges which Chriſt hath put in their keeping upon ſuch termes, and contend earneſtly againſt their irregular wayes of demanding them, and adviſe them to be contented to take
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170084:46"/> them in the way and order preſcribed by Chriſt, to ſeek of him in the uſe of meanes, a <hi>new heart,</hi> ſenſible of the burthen of their ſinnes, and the wrath due unto them, and in that way to come to Chriſt for pardon and peace, and it ſhall then be as freely theirs as any ones in the World; theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ſlanderers reproach the Miniſters of the Goſpel as unfaithful to their truſt, as ſtreightening the free grace of their Maſter Chriſt for their own ends, and with theſe clamors get into corners, and forge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit writings and ſeals themſelves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite others to come in, and take the like from them, at the ſame rate on which they came by theirs.</p>
               <p>And thus becomes this deluded gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be ſo peſtered with a rabble of drunken, lying, Sabboth breaking, unclean, heretical, blaſphemous pretenders to Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſalvation, which are the reproach and burthen of this, and will be (except God be infinitely gracious unto this Land beyond expectation) the bane (as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and godlineſſe) of ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

Do you love to ſleepe your ſelves into hell, that ye are angry at them that pinch you for awakening your conſciences, &amp; diſcovering your danger? The gnat in <hi>Virgil</hi> was requited but ill by the ſhepherd, when he killed him for ſtinging him out of his ſleep at that very inſtant when a ſerpent was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſting him to death. But juſt ſuch uſage have Gods Miniſters from this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am not to believe every mans eſtate to be ſo good as he pretend, or (it may be) himſelfe thinks it to be. The Phyſician will not believe every patient that tells him he is well, and nothing ayles him. He knowes it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170084:49"/> is a ſigne the diſeaſe is moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> when the patient <hi>feels</hi> it not. I am ſure this is no ſigne of Saintſhip not to be able to bear a reproof, nay not to hear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ſermon. Nay it gives ſuſpicion that they are not <hi>ſound</hi> but <hi>rotten,</hi> that cannot endure to have their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces handled. If ſuch perſons be Saints, I know not who be ſinners: if they be ſound and ſincere, I know not who are hypocrites. Sure it was a note of <hi>Davids</hi> ſincerity to yield up himſelfe to the Lord to ſearch and try him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. 23. to invite the <hi>righteous to ſmite him</hi> (not <hi>ſtroke</hi> him) and account it a <hi>precious balme that ſhould not break his head, Pſal.</hi> 141. 5.

               <p>2.

A Miniſter is not only a <hi>nurſe,</hi> or a <hi>waterer,</hi> but a <hi>father,</hi> and a <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> alſo. He muſt preach for <hi>converſion,</hi> that Chriſts <hi>body</hi> may be compleat in <hi>members,</hi> as well as for <hi>edification,</hi> that thoſe <hi>members</hi> may be compleat in <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>comforts.</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170084:50"/> it may not be <hi>for their hurt</hi> if it do. It may be they may have built too haſtily, and though God will not overthrow the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every failing of the builder, yet he may exerciſe it with ſome ſtormes, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its cracks, and ſhew where it needs props, and where it was cemented with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter. A Chriſtians comfort and peace may have many materials of his own mixing, hay and ſtubble in the frame, and thoſe will God one way or other work out: there may be more of <hi>reaſon</hi> in it, then of <hi>Faith;</hi> it may be rather a <hi>ſilencing</hi> conſcience, then a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of conſcience.

               <p>2. If the worſt come of it that can be, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome Saint in the preaching the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170084:50"/> of <hi>Satan,</hi> making the truths of God the matter of temptation: and (as to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſing of the thing and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) this ought to be looked upon as a <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God,</hi> by which he will do ſomething extraordinary in ſuch a ſoul. But the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is doing his duty, he is dealing blowes according to his commiſſion among the <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of God; if a <hi>friend</hi> of God will needs run out of his way, and put his head under the ſword, 'tis his own fault if he bleed. Much of this often comes to paſſe through our <hi>neglect of prayer</hi> before we come to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that God will manage his own ſword with his own hand, directing the Miniſter to give every one his portion, and enabling us to diſcerne and receive ours, and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenderneſſe and ſcrupulouſneſſe of ſpirit that ſome Saints are ſubject unto: of which, in the end of the ſecond Book.</p>
               <p>3. Suppoſe it be the <hi>Miniſters fault,</hi> not wilfully and purpoſely (for that is a wicked Prophets character, wilfully, and of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to <hi>make ſad the hearts of the righteous whom the Lord will not have made ſad, Ezek.</hi> 13. 22.) but through indiſcretion or want of caution in the delivery of terrifying truths, to wound the conſcience of a ſpirit; yet he would doe farre more miſchiefe, if by the neglect of preaching ſuch Truths from a feare of ſo doing, he ſhould ſuffer the <hi>wicked</hi> whom <hi>the Lord would have ſaddened, to flatter himſelfe in his own eyes,</hi> either by

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was a kind of <hi>diſgrace</hi> to be a <hi>Saint,</hi> and in thoſe times, it was not to be wondred at, if there were few that pretended to the <hi>name</hi> without the thing. No man will <hi>perſonate</hi> a Saint, of purpoſe to be perſecuted for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the badge of a counterfeited holineſſe. But, now God hath made the <hi>name o Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honourable</hi> (though truly except the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God had been generally better fitted to manage the condition God hath brought them to, it may be it had been better for the credit of the Goſpel hereafter, that it had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill layen under hatches then been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Politicians; to bear the name of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, whiles they indeed ſteere the veſſel to their own ends:) but I ſay, the Lord hath for ſome late years made the <hi>name of Religion ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> he hath put a diadem of glory upon its head, the appearance of it hath been in divers places the main qualification for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and places of advantage; and 'tis ſtrange to ſee how many converts, the meer complexion of the times hath made.

There were not more <hi>Jews</hi> made by <hi>fear</hi> in the days of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> then there are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in theſe dayes

               <p>'Tis ſome comfort to a <hi>patient</hi> that he is in a way of <hi>recovery,</hi> though he be not aſſured that he ſhall recover, yet when he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſuch ſymptomes upon himſelfe, as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually go before recovery in others, how much are his ſpirits refreſhed with this? 'Tis the comfort of a <hi>Traveller,</hi> when he knows he is in the <hi>way</hi> to his journies end, after long wandring in a wilderneſſe; whereby he is encouraged to proceed, though perhaps it be a very difficult paſſage, rocky, dirty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable every way, in it ſelf; though his horſe be dull, or ſet hard in his pace, the weather bad, yet (ſaith he) I am in the way to my journies end, and I may, if I careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve directions, attain it at laſt; and this hope puts ſpirits into him, whenever the difficulties that I have ſpoken of diſcourage him. Now who ever thou art, that art in a like condition, though the way which the Spirit of bondage conducts thee in, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170084:55"/> with many difficulties &amp; diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet cheer up thou art in an hopefull way to thy journeys end. 'Tis the way in which thou mayſt arrive at the joyful liberty of the <hi>Spirit of Adoption.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But I am before told that I may yet miſſe of the end, and what comfort then can therebe in ſuch a way, wherein I may miſcarry after I have gone through abundance of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties?</p>

                  <label>A.</label> I anſwer, True thou mayſt; yet there is much comfort, or ſupport rather. Fr,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though thou <hi>mayſt</hi> fall, yet thou <hi>mayſt not,</hi> In thy former condition it was not ſo with thee: The way thou waſt in, there was nothing in it but <hi>certain</hi> deſtruction, that way led directly, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>to the chambers of death, Prov.</hi> 7. 2. 7. thou waſt <hi>without hope, Eph.</hi> 2. 12.

               <p n="2">2. Thou art under the conduct of one, whoſe diſcovery, if thou wilt follow, thou art aſſured not to fall away? 'Tis thy own fault, if thou do ſo. The Spirit that hath led thee ſo farre, is an unerriug guide, a faithfull conductor: never any one miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that once came into this way, but for neglect of his counſell, and turning aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ways of his own, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32.

If thou continue in this <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſuſpecting</hi> fear, and follow God in the uſe of all his own ordinances, if thou ſhouldeſt miſcarry at laſt, it would be a ſingular caſe; Gods uſual dealing with perſons under ſuch a work is otherwiſe.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170084:56"/> and poſſibly to thy ſelfe, of the iſſue, from theſe following notes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If the <hi>ſinnes</hi> a man is convinced of, be not only <hi>actual,</hi> but alſo, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Original;</hi> when he ſees not onely his <hi>actions</hi> damnable, but his <hi>nature</hi> even before he had a being, condemned; when he complains not only, or principally of ſuch particular ſins, but alike or more feelingly complains under the <hi>body of death,</hi> that he is poſſeſt withall. For this man is moſt likely to be ſeriouſly converted from ſinne, who doth not onely aym at the <hi>branches</hi> or <hi>ſhrowds,</hi> but lays <hi>the Axe</hi> of repentance at the very <hi>root.</hi> To another, who is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced onely of the evill of one or two <hi>maſter ſinnes</hi> (though they may make a ſtir in the conſcience for a while, and that may <hi>drive</hi> the man to a <hi>wall,</hi> ſo that he ſees he muſt kill <hi>them</hi> or they will kill <hi>him,</hi> and thereupon the man reformes, and is taken notice of for a renewed man) ſinne will come in at a <hi>poſterne door</hi> as faſt as he drives it out at the <hi>great gate,</hi> nay all his labour will be no other then <hi>Hercules</hi> his was about the many heads of <hi>Hydra</hi> (as the Poets fancy) they multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him as faſt as he cuts them off. It being proper to ſinne, when dealt with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,<hi>—creſcere per damnum,—</hi>to <hi>gain</hi> by <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> by being <hi>cut down.</hi> One particular ſinne may deſtroy another: For,</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:170084:57"/>
               <p>There is ſcarce a luſt in a man, but as it is contrary to grace, ſo is it oppoſite to ſome other luſt; ſo that what <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> loſeth, commonly <hi>Prodigality</hi> gains, and ſo <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> But if Original ſin by ſuch convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be aſſaulted, ſuch a man goes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way to a through Converſion: he <hi>begins</hi> at the right <hi>end.</hi> Indeed, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome <hi>actual</hi> ſin uſually begins this work, but leaves it never it till it ſtrike <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> too.</p>
               <p>(2.) Not only <hi>open</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> but <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> and (of thoſe eſpecially) <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſins. Many a man may be grieviouſly terrified under the guilt of ſuch or ſuch a <hi>notorious</hi> ſin, and forſake it, and yet may not be really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: ſhame of the world, diſadvantage in point of eſtate, or (poſſibly) the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right blowes of a powerful Miniſtry, will not let him enjoy that quietly. But when a mans conviction is deepeſt for <hi>undiſcerned ſins, ſecret, inward</hi> ſins, <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſins, ſuch as formality, hypocriſie, hardneſſe of heart, &amp;c. this is a good ſigne, this conviction is likely to end in effectual converſion; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the grief and ſorrow occaſioned by theſe ſins, bears a more immediate relation to the holineſſe of God who only is offended by them, they being ſuch as none elſe can take cognizance of.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If a man under ſoul troubles be <hi>full, free, ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> in his <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of ſin, and in his <hi>cenſures</hi> concerning
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170084:57"/> himſelf. I love in ſuch a caſe to hear a ſoul ſay the worſt of it ſelf that can be, when it ſayes it ſenſibly and cordially, (as in ſuch ſoul troubles it hath little ſtomack to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement or diſſemble,) <hi>Oh what a vile wretch am I? I am perſwaded thouſands of my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in hell. Did you ever know any one guilty of my ſins, with my aggravations?</hi> Thus was <hi>Paul</hi> in his converſion (for to that time his confeſſion refers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.) convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he was the <hi>chief of ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now among all <hi>aggravations of ſin</hi> (if you lay the compariſon) the moſt ingenuous are, ſuch as are drawne from <hi>abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> large and liberal <hi>means,</hi> frequent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,</hi> infinite <hi>patience, &amp;c.</hi> A ſoul that chargeth it ſelf home here, ſeems to have ſome touches of a more then ordinary ſpirit. There is a Promiſe to this condition, as a threatning to the contrary, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 28. 13.</p>

If a man <hi>juſtifie</hi> God and the Law by which he ſtands <hi>condemned.</hi> For herein is a very great meaſure of humiliation evidenced and hereby is God mightily honoured. And certainly then is our deſign for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moſt likely to be ſucceſſefully carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, when it involves Gods honour with it. This heart is throughly broken when it will not reſiſt God ſo much as in a thought, although he go to hell for ever. Another that is not ſo kindly wrought upon <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.

               <p n="4">IV.

If (which is a notable prognoſtick of a good iſſue to conſcience troubles) a mans greateſt trouble be for that he is <hi>ſelfiſh in his troubles;</hi> that his grief for ſin is ſo much of kin to his own <hi>deſire of ſalvation, and fear of hell and puniſhment.

To be troubled firſt for ſin, and then for the ſin of thoſe troubles, declares that a man pants and longs after a perfect <hi>holineſs,</hi> as well as <hi>happineſs,</hi> and that is a bleſſed condition.</p>

And laſtly, If ſuch a ſoul be ſhy and fearful of taking ſanctuary in <hi>promiſing</hi> and <hi>reſolving.</hi> For this is a good ſign, that he will not ſplit upon the rock of ſelf-Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that at preſent he is ſo throughly humbled, that he dares not arrogate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one thred in the whole web of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he throughly knowes the evil and plague of his own deceitful heart.

By <hi>timorous deſpondency and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize of ſpirit.</hi> Thus many a ſoul that hath begun well in this way, hath met with a ſerious conviction in a Sermon, and been contented to follow it, upon hope its work would ſoon be over, and thereupon hath ſet upon a ſerious ſearch of his ways, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confeſſed, and mourned for ſinne, and for all this can ſee no progreſſe at all that he makes either in holineſſe or peace, multitudes of luſts ſtrive ſtill, and it may be he now feels them ſtirring more then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as a waking man feels every flea that bites him, but a ſleeping man though he have many about him, yet feels them not) and multitudes of <hi>temptations</hi> aſſault him which he could not foreſee. And now (ſaith he) I perceive I am entering into a <hi>melancholy profeſſion,</hi> and I ſee no end of it, and thus 'twill be with me ſo long as I hearken to conſcience, and ſuffer every ſinne to trouble me thus; I expected peace and comfort in this way, but I ſee now there is no hopes of it whiles I am ſo nice and ſcrupulous, and therefore I will give my ſelfe ſcope, and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowroome, and not loſe my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents which I can enjoy at my pleaſure, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170084:63"/> wait for others which I deſpair of ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to attain. And then he concludes deſperately thus, I have ceaſed from my wicked ways, and prayed, and ſought the face of God, and waited upon Sermons, &amp;c. yet can I get no peace, no anſwer of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to my ſoul, God ſtops his ears to the <hi>voice of my roaring,</hi> and I am out of all hopes of ever attaining a ſound peace in my conſcience; heaven is everlaſtingly ſhut, and hell open to my ſoul; wherefore it is the beſt way in mine eys to give my heart content whiles I may, and to take the preſent time, and drive away theſe melancholy thoughts with ſanguine refreſhments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating pleaſures, to eat and drink ſeeing to morrow I muſt dye. Thus the Devil that was caſt out in the heat of firſt convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, returns again this way, and not only ſtops converſion at preſent, but barrs the heart ever after againſt all ſcruples tending that way. Such a thought as this had like to have undone <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſert, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By <hi>a ſecret hanging, and bankering of heart after ſome ſinne,</hi> under ſoul troubles, and the Spirit of bondage. A man may be angry with one ſinne, and grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the guilt of it, whiles he carries a more favourable reſpect to <hi>another.</hi> As a father that hath many children that he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed withal, may fall out with one that hath offended him grievouſly, and wiſh he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170084:63"/> had never begotten him, and yet loves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly another child who hath not ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended him, and then it falls out that the child that there is not ſo much ſpleen againſt, recovers his favour, and makes way thereby for the reducing of his affections to his brother that lies under more heavie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Or rather as a politique Prince that being vexed with the clamours of the people, will ſacrifice ſome favourites to ſave the reſt. One ſinne may undo ſuch a man, as <hi>Ananias Acts</hi> 5. <hi>Magus, Acts</hi> 8. Sometimes he loves that ſin ſtill which he is fallen out with, and wiſheth he had never had to do with, and exclaims againſt it, and againſt himſelfe for entertaining it; and that by degrees wins his favour again: as a rogue and an whore ſometimes fall out ſo grievouſly that they call one another all the fowleſt names that can be, and utter all bitter expreſſions poſſible againſt each other, yea wiſh hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had never ſeen the faces of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet within a few hours can be reconciled again, and be as great together as ever they were. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Moſes</hi> faireſt under the rod, yet ſtill kept in his heart a deſire and reſolution to keepe <hi>Iſrael</hi> in bondage. So the <hi>Elders of Iſrael</hi> that <hi>enquired</hi> diligently (in appearance) <hi>after the Lord,</hi> yet ſet up their <hi>Idols in their heart</hi> ſtill, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. This a man may do, and yet at preſent not diſcern it. He may by conſequence, though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170084:64"/> will the ſame ſin he is troubled for; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whiles he wils the <hi>temptations</hi> to it, or <hi>wiſheth</hi> he were <hi>free</hi> to it, and could get leave of his conſcience to live in it ſecurely, and without diſturbance: perhaps he may have trouble for <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>unlawful gains,</hi> and he ſeems very much bent againſt it, yet perhaps he hath ſome <hi>gainful way,</hi> which he hath before perſwaded his conſcience to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, ſuppoſe that of <hi>moderate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or the like, which he allowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, that brings all back againe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By ſecret hypocriſie of heart, which hinders a man from diſcovering the bottom of his Wound. There is this natural evil in the heart of moſt men, though they be as vile as any, yet they are loath to own their evils, at leaſt, with all their aggravations; indeed they are vile creatures, but yet they are not <hi>ſo bad</hi> as people think them; they have <hi>done</hi> evil indeed, but they were <hi>drawn</hi> in by others, they had a <hi>good end</hi> in what they did, they have not <hi>made a trade</hi> of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such hypocritical <hi>concealments</hi> as theſe muſt needs hinder the deepneſs of <hi>conviction</hi> in themſelves, and occaſion a miſ-application of the remedy by thoſe who are the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Phyſicians of ſouls in ſuch caſes. As if a <hi>Patient</hi> deal deceitfully with a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and diſcover not the bottom and root of his <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> as far as he can, no wonder if he miſcarry, ſeeing the Phyſicians medicines are intended to meet with no diſtemper but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170084:64"/> that which is diſcovered, and ſo far only as it is ſo.</p>
               <p>Beſides, 'tis poſſible in ſome ſoul-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the hypocriſie may be more groſſe in more notorious ſinners, who intend to make no other uſe of it then barely to <hi>right</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a <hi>forged</hi> repentance and contrition in the eyes of thoſe whom they have ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized. Theſe both appear notoriouſly in the caſe of <hi>Saul;</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> had charged home upon him his diſobedience in <hi>ſparing Agag,</hi> firſt he playes the hypocrite more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in excuſing the ſin, <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in tranſgreſſing the Commandment of the Lord, but I feared the people.</hi> And when that cover will not do the deed, then he confeſſeth it more largely, that he had <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> he was convinced of it, his excuſe would not hold water: But why did <hi>Saul</hi> confeſſe ſo much? See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Yet honour me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He playes the hypocrite more notoriouſly in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, then he did before in his excuſes. Thence ſound converts ſo often complaine of a fear of hypocriſie even in their <hi>complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Spiritual pride</hi> may undo a convinced ſoul. It may make a man take that for the <hi>end,</hi> which is but the <hi>way,</hi> nay but the firſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170084:65"/> 
                  <hi>ſtep</hi> in the way. Trouble of conſcience for ſin is a rare thing in the world, and where it is wrought in the ſoul, (to any large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure eſpecially) it puts a great difference between man and man; this difference a ſoul may apprehend too ſoon, ſo as to be puffed up with the experience of ſuch a work on his ſpirit. Suppoſe of a crew of <hi>profane perſons,</hi> the conſcience of one may bee troubled for his lewd courſes, and this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſticks cloſe, and drives him from his looſe companions, and to reſolve upon a new courſe of life. Now is Satan apt to ſtrike in, and blow up the heart with the thoughts of this work, and the man, (by comparing himſelf with what he was, and what his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates ſtill are) is apt to think, Sure, now I am in a good condition, for I have been troubled for my ſins, and forſaken my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes, and therefore I am ſavingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and therefore I have ground to take comfort, and apply Promiſes to my ſelfe, and entertain no more doubts of my condition. Here let me (at leaſt) allude to <hi>Matth-</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. The <hi>unclean ſpirit</hi> may (in ſome <hi>notorious</hi> luſt or other) be caſt out, and he is <hi>reſt leſſe</hi> till he have again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his poſſeſſion, and therefore wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a time till it be <hi>ſwept and garniſhed,</hi> till a barren profeſſion of Religion be taken up, and pride make ſuch perſons carry it high, (this furniſheth a lodging for the Divel) then he returnes, but in another diſguiſe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170084:65"/> (ſuch an <hi>unclean dirty ſpirit</hi> muſt never think to be harboured again in a <hi>garniſhed houſe,</hi> therefore) he may perhaps <hi>wipe his ſhooes</hi> at the door, and under a pretence of <hi>holineſſe</hi> or <hi>light,</hi> may get a firmer poſſeſſion. An <hi>erroneous</hi> Divel in ſuch a proud heart may get poſſeſſion, when a <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Divel cannot, though afterwards he open the door to more ſcandalous and unclean then himſelf.

And this is <hi>overhaſtening the birth,</hi> which occaſions many <hi>diſtortions, weakneſſes,</hi> and <hi>defects</hi> in the perſon ſo <hi>born into the new world,</hi> and divers times expoſeth the ſoul to eternal undoing, ſeeing there are very few, if any, over <hi>early</hi> and <hi>abortive</hi> children, but are <hi>ſtill-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is to be conſidered that all Promiſes that concerne the <hi>Application of Comfort</hi> to us are conditional; and we are not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it but only to <hi>capable Subjects.</hi> So (as I have ſhewed before) Chriſt tyes his <hi>yoak</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> together, and <hi>feeling</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving</hi> the weight of ſin are in the ſame place conjoyned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29, 30. And the comfortable <hi>indwelling</hi> of the preſence of God in any ſoul, is conditioned with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>contrite</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> frame of ſpirit, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſai.</hi> 66. 2 And <hi>bleſſed are the Mourners, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Mat. 5. 4. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ere God will ſpeak, he will not onely find <hi>ſhewes</hi> of theſe tempers, but <hi>realities;</hi> and therefore a Miniſter, who is Gods Deputy, in dealing with ſuch perſons, ſhould labour to come neer him herein: for how can Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters keep to their commiſſion, if they <hi>looſe</hi> where God <hi>binds?</hi> 'Tis true, they are not bound to an infallibility of concluding that ſuch a work is true, but only to judg by the effects; but when they have ſufficient evidence to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170084:67"/> ſway their judgement concerning the real converſion of any ſoul, then to ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is a <hi>duty, Iſai.</hi> 40. 1. till then, 'tis a <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way then how to deal with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is this. We muſt ſearch whether the trouble be real or counterfeit, ſleight or deep fowl or clean, inflamed or not, and (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) either <hi>widen</hi> the wound more, to make it capable of admitting a <hi>Tent,</hi> or apply a <hi>lenitive plaiſter</hi> to allay the <hi>fire</hi> of it, or a <hi>drawing</hi> one to fetch out the <hi>corruption;</hi> or laſtly, an <hi>healing</hi> to cloſe the <hi>Orifice.</hi> And indeed, whiles the trouble is meerly <hi>legal</hi> and from a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> the main care and skil of a Miniſter or friend, as to ſuch a one, ought to be to find out the mean between theſe two extremes, the <hi>heightning</hi> the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo as to render the ſoul too ſuperſtitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful to cloſe with Chriſt, and <hi>lightning</hi> or <hi>aſſwaging</hi> it ſo as to undo the ſoul by a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory and unſound cloſure with him. He that can thus diſtinguiſh ſeaſons of applying the Law and Goſpel, (let me ſay of him, as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of him that knowes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them,) <hi>Sciat ſe eſſe bonum Theologum;</hi> Let him know he is a good Divine indeed.</p>

And think how God may then mind you of thoſe former paſſages;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170084:68"/> and that with juſt indignation, if now you any way lift up the heele againſt him.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Watchfulneſſe:</hi> conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That (although the Holy Spirit be not the Author of it) yet freſh ſins may occaſion the reducing you into the ſame troubles. True, thy condition (being once in Chriſt) can never be ſo <hi>unſafe</hi> as formerly, but it may be altogether as <hi>uncomfortable,</hi> nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more uncomfortable then it was before. I ſay, <hi>more uncomfortable;</hi> becauſe your ſins will have aggravations then, that they were not capable of before, and the <hi>hopes</hi> which you have been raiſed unto by converſion, and it may be <hi>comfort,</hi> will increaſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of your falling from them.</p>
               <p>That which I have ſaid before concerning the <hi>ends of the Spirit</hi> in bringing us into ſuch an houſe of bondage, would afford us a new meditation here; it being our duty to accompliſh the ends of the Spirit in all his works. And therefore I ſhall for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution of this head, refer you to the fourth of thoſe ends before mentioned, only remember what I ſay, <hi>Sins after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may make us doubt whether ever we were converted, and ſo make us act</hi> over all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tragical parts again, which ever wee paſſed through before converſion, even ſins of <hi>omiſſion:</hi> and I cannot but think, that the Apoſtle may intend ſome ſuch intimation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9 <hi>He that lacketh theſe things; i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170084:69"/> that neglects to grow in grace (as is preſſed in the preceding verſes) <hi>is blind, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſinnes, i. e.</hi> may queſtion whether ever he were or no, and the following words more encline me to this interpretation. It follows, <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, labour to make your calling and election ſure, &amp;c. v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Sathan watcheth all advantages to reduce you back again, if not to a ſtate of condemnation, yet to an apprehenſion of it. Keep your evidences, and your aſſurances e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in your eye. Watch againſt temptations that tend to enſlave you again. So will a captive to the Turk, when once eſcaped, take heed of ſtaying within the reach of his cruel task-maſter.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall take up this again here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, on the fifth Doctrine, and thither refer you.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>Thankfulneſſe,</hi> which will alſo be heightened by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>important a work</hi> it is, that God hath wrought in you. It is a work that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſalvation,</hi> for whom he <hi>calls, he juſtifies, and (by conſequence) glorifies, Rom.</hi> 8. 30. So that although it were troubleſome in working, yet you may bleſſe God howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſeeing it is thus wrought, to all eternity. O how little was the trouble to the benefit of it!</p>
               <p n="2">2. How <hi>many difficulties</hi> and <hi>improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> ſuch as quite damped your hopes, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170084:69"/> ſunk your ſpirits, you met withall, in that dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſage.

               <p n="3">3. The many <hi>provocations</hi> peculiar to that condition which you were guilty of in your darkneſſe. Here follow me again with your experiences, <hi>ye redeemed of the Lord;</hi> let you and I read over <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78. <hi>and</hi> 106. and let us look back upon our <hi>wilderneſſe-ſins</hi> how oft did we <hi>ſpeak againſt God, ſaying, Can God furniſh a table in the wilderneſſe?</hi> How often have we <hi>murmured</hi> becauſe of the length and tediouſneſſe of our troubles, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170084:70"/> wiſhed that we had <hi>dyed in Egypt?</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we longed for <hi>quails for our luſt,</hi> bin diſcontented at Gods allowance, and thought all we had (even precious <hi>manna,</hi> gracious <hi>meltings</hi> for ſin, a tender <hi>fear</hi> of offending God, an holy <hi>importunity</hi> in following after God, &amp;c.) nothing, if we were not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of his love, and <hi>kiſſed with the kiſſes of his mouth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think how much of <hi>unbeliefe, impatience, pride, peeviſhneſſe, unthankfulneſſe, deſpaire, hard thoughts againſt God, wearineſſe of his ſervice, unjuſt cenſures againſt your ſelves, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, murtherous thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> hath God paſt by, and in all theſe provocations kept you from falling off from your preſent convictions, and the benefit of them, and held you in his hand, and conducted you through the <hi>wild and roaring wilderneſſe,</hi> till he hath brought you to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>multitude of thoſe who periſh</hi> under convictions, and notwithſtanding them, nay periſh the deeper for them. When a man conſiders that the ſame troubles of ſpirit which drove <hi>Judas</hi> to the Gallowes, and <hi>Cain</hi> to deſpair, and to many thouſands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of grace, become barely means of hardening the heart, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their condemnation; prove <hi>to him</hi> the throws of a new birth, the rough paſſage to a Kingdom of liberty and glory, the ſtraight doore to a pallace of ſpiritual peace, and comfort. <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> mercy is <hi>engaging</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170084:70"/> mercy. And diſtinguiſhing mercy is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, when to the perſons diſtinguiſhed every thing is common, but that very diſtinction. As if, in a common guilt, <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>pardoned</hi> whiles <hi>others</hi> dye, and in a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> diſeaſe, <hi>ſome</hi> periſh, and <hi>others</hi> are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: ſo here in common ſoul troubles, one man deſpairs, and ſends himſelf to hell the <hi>ſooner;</hi> another preſumes, and fends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thither the <hi>ſurer, &amp;c.</hi> Others are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally converted, and eternally ſaved.

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>conſcience</hi> is at peace, this is a dangerous and undoing peace. Conſcience is the ſoules faithful <hi>watchman,</hi> and will (if it bee not blind) when it's let alone in its duty, give faithfull intelligence of its danger in time,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170084:73"/> that it may be avoided. Now when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is diſcouraged herein, and prevailed withal, to ſpeak nothing but pleaſing things, how ſoon, and how ſuddenly will ſuch perſons ſouls be ſurprized and ruined before they are aware of it? A thouſand times better to have a <hi>roaring</hi> conſcience, then a <hi>ſleeping</hi> conſcience, and a <hi>ſullen</hi> conſcience that will never ſpeak a <hi>good</hi> word to a man, then a <hi>fawning</hi> conſcience that wil never (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be never ſo great cauſe) ſpeak a <hi>bad</hi> one.</p>
               <p>Hereby doth Satan ſecure a ſoul againſt ſaving converſion for the future. See <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 27. and God ſayes <hi>Amen</hi> to it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6 9. <hi>John</hi> 12. 40.</p>

So it is with men in this caſe, when they are reſolved to be at peace with their <hi>defiled conſciences,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any termes, they wilfully turne their backs upon ſuch Miniſters as ſay not what they will have them, and if it were in their power, would uſe them no better then <hi>Ahab</hi> uſed <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and <hi>Herod John the Baptiſt.</hi> And now I have mentioned <hi>Herod,</hi> me thinks I ſee him juſt ſuch a man as I am now diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, a man convinced, and very likely to become a convert, one that <hi>heard John gladly</hi> a great while; and ſure he was much wrought on that could pleaſe himſelf in ſo auſtere and ſowre a Preacher as <hi>John</hi> was: but when he had prevailed with conſcience to wink at his ſinful pleaſure with <hi>Herodias,</hi> then becauſe <hi>John</hi> made ſo much noiſe of the buſineſſe, that both the King and his Minion were afraid he would make that tell-tale awake, and look abroad againe, and ſtare them in the face; the Preacher muſt be laid in priſon, and his head muſt be cut off to keep his tongue quiet.</p>
               <p>Now when a man hath brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch a paſſe (as to all ordinary and likely meanes of converſion) he is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>

               <p>2. A Second Duty incumbent upon ſuch perſons, is to labour to <hi>reduce again thoſe loſt impreſſions of the Spirit of Bondage.</hi> I confeſſe, it is a very hard matter to recover a ſpirit of conviction and compunction again, when it is once loſt; yet it may be had, the ſoul being firſt made deeply ſenſible (as was before required) of the evil and danger of checking and loſing it, and following God in all his Ordinances conſcienciouſly for its recovery. But truly, 'tis a very rare thing, without very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Grace, for ſuch impreſſions to be (at leaſt effectually) renewed. As in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>relapſes,</hi> nature having made many attempts to caſt out her enemy, and failing, is ordinarily ſo wearyed out, that it is an extreme difficult thing to apply any Phyſick ſtrong enough to conquer the diſeaſe, and yet not too ſtrong for nature to manage; and therefore it requires the more labor with our hearts to effect.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170084:75"/>
               <p>
                  <label>Object.</label> If thou object; But <hi>Sir,</hi> theſe remedies are in vain preſcribed to me, who, if I could do theſe things, ſhould have no need to complain of the diſeaſe, ſeeing the very cure conſiſts in being able to apply ſuch means to effect it. If I could be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of this ſin, and be <hi>humbled</hi> deeply for it, and <hi>wait upon means</hi> as I ought, my heart would be no longer ſuch as you ſpeak of; I complain of an hard heart, and an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart, and you ſeem to bid me get a penitent heart, that I may get a penitent heart. And this ſeems abſurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. It may be, this very caſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken into conſideration, will affect the heart when no other thing will. And we find it by the experience of Gods called ones, that they find nothing more uſual, then to be moſt ſenſible of their own hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inſenſibleneſſe. And 'tis ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hardneſſe of heart is not only a <hi>ſin</hi> but a <hi>judgment.</hi> Now ſenſe of judgment may bring ſenſe of ſin. I adviſe thee therefore to be ſenſible of it as a judgment, that thou maiſt be made ſenſible of it in time as a ſin.</p>
               <p>2 To one in thy condition this is the great and <hi>maſter ſin,</hi> and by conſequence, the moſt dangerous wound of thy ſoul, and therefore 'tis moſt <hi>ſutable</hi> and likely to be <hi>ſucceſſeful,</hi> to begin the work of ſorrow and humiliation at that ſin. As in a <hi>complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of many <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> in a Patient, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170084:76"/> thinks it moſt proper to apply himſelf to the <hi>Maſter-Diſtemper</hi> primarily and principally, and the reſt will abate with it, they being but <hi>Symptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. When I bid thee labour for a ſpirit deeply affected with this ſinne, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to reduce thy ſelfe to thy former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions thereby, I purpoſely preſcribe this courſe; Becauſe I know if thou canſt attaine an heart ſenſible of its own reſiſtance to the Spirit of grace, &amp;c. thou art ſo farre recovered. And this advantage is peculiar to this condition, that to be affected <hi>with it,</hi> is to be recovered <hi>out of it.</hi> And this is a great encouragement to labour for this frame of ſpirit. As one ſin begets another, ſo humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for one, will beget humiliation for all; for the ſame tenderneſſe which renders the heart capable of the impreſſion of godly ſorrow for one ſin, renders it as penetrable by others.</p>
               <p>4. When I bid thee labour to recover thy former tenderneſſe, I mean not, as if I would have thee reduce thy ſelfe thereunto by a power in thy ſelfe, but by addreſſing thy ſelfe to God by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate prayer, to take away that reſiſtance, hardneſs, and impenitency of thy heart, which ſo frequently repulſeth the Spirit of God, and rejecteth its own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Go to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſay, Lord, I have an hard heart, an heart that cannot repent;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170084:76"/> (according to promiſe) <hi>give me an heart of fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> But I have a great deal of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and the courſe you adviſe to, will put all out of order again.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſ.</label> 1. I have told thee before, that tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>break</hi> an unſound peace of conſcience here, then to <hi>continue</hi> it all our lives, till Death and Hell breake it whether wee will or no. Eſpecially, ſeeing,</p>
               <p>2. The breaking of this <hi>falſe</hi> peace is a way to recover a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſound</hi> peace. Then wee are towards a peace with God, when we fall out with our ſelves and our ſins. When we combine againſt his enemies, in that work he is engaged to aſſiſt us, and if we be once abſolutely broken from them, and engaged to the deſtruction of them, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> we become his confederates.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> But I have had a <hi>great name for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and have borne my ſelfe high upon my comfortable attainements and enjoyments, and I cannot bring my ſelfe to be willing to take the ſhame of a confeſſion, that I have beene beguiled my ſelfe, and deluded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Therefore tis likely thy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements will do thee more good, as (on the other ſide) thy example in going on in ſo deluſive a way, will do far more hurt. <hi>Peters diſſimulation</hi> drew many <hi>to diſſemble alſo.

Thus I remember in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> there is a ſtory of a <hi>Popiſh Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which when one had confidently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſaw, divers others in the company would needs profeſſe to ſee it too. So do deluded ſouls ſtrengthen one another til the juggle of Satan be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>2. Here is <hi>thy</hi> glory and <hi>Gods</hi> put in the balance, and it is a great trial of thy ſincerity to ſee which thou wilt take. <hi>My ſonne, give glory to God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan;</hi> and ſo I to thee, Friend <hi>give glory to God:</hi> Let the <hi>pride</hi> of thy heart be <hi>abaſed,</hi> and thy <hi>high looks be brought low, that the Lord alone may be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>3. This is the way to thy own greater eſteem. Humble thy ſelfe, and the Lord will exalt thee in due time. Hereby wilt thou give to thoſe that are truly godly a firme proofe of thy ſincerity, and ſuch a return to them will ſpeak more then thy ſtay among them poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would have done.</p>
               <p>4. If God do not bring thee thus low now, he will hereafter. What is temporary ſhame, and contempt to everlaſting ſhame and contempt?</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 'Tis true of the <hi>grace of hope,</hi> that it proceeds from <hi>faith</hi> in order of nature, and is a fruit of converſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. and till converſion we cannot <hi>rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi> But there is another hope, that is <hi>not always gracious,</hi> (though poſſibly ſometimes grace may be <hi>ſeminally</hi> in it, and may firſt appear by it, as the firſt act of faith may appear in ſuch an act of hope as this. True, I am a condemned creature, but there are ſuch and ſuch free offers of Chriſt, and promiſes of mercy to ſinners indefinitely, and why not to me?) yet I ſay, this hope is <hi>not always gracious,</hi> becauſe it is common to <hi>preſumptuous</hi> as well as <hi>repenting</hi> ſinners, and is the very ground on which they preſume. This hope I ſhall for diſtinctions ſake call a <hi>moral or rational hope,</hi> becauſe it is gathered from the general promiſes of Scripture, in a rational way, as alſo, becauſe it is but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, probable hope, that is accompanied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>opinion</hi> and not <hi>faith,</hi> though it may ground faith as to its <hi>act of reliance</hi> upon
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170084:81"/> Chriſt and the promiſe of mercy in him where the Spirit of God pleaſeth to infuſe faith in ſuch a rational way, as divers times he doth. Whereas the hope that flows from faith is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>infuſed hope,</hi> and is not ſo much the apprehending a <hi>poſſibility,</hi> as expecting a certainty of fulfilling the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to me in particular, ariſing (I mean in the acts of it, not in the habit or ſeed of it, for that is infuſed in the firſt vital act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon Chriſt, which unites to Chriſt, and ſo juſtifies:) <hi>ariſing</hi> I ſay, from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evidence of my juſtification by faith, and ſo from an act of aſſurance, and is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or lower like it. Diſtinguiſh thus. The one is a kind of <hi>negative</hi> hope, the other a <hi>poſitive.</hi> The one ſaith, <hi>I am not excluded;</hi> the other ſaith, <hi>I am included.</hi> Its language is, <hi>Why not I?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis the former hope, that <hi>rational, moral hope,</hi> I adviſe thee to keep alive in thy ſoul. Let no power of corruption, no ſtrength of temptation, no length or grievouſneſſe of thy ſoul troubles, no falſe concluſions from Gods decree of reprobation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. drive thee out of a firm aſſent to this propoſition, that <hi>though thy caſe be ſad, yet it is not deſperate;</hi> God hath invited ſuch as thou art, hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Chriſt and grace freely to thee among others, and therefore thou art by no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declared act of Gods excluded more then any other. It is a great ſupport that a ſoul in this caſe gets by ſuch an argument
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170084:82"/> as this is. For although grace do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend or accompany this hope, yet the Spirit of God doth uſe it as it doth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparatory works, to diſpoſe the ſoul for grace. Nay, I know not, but that if the ſoul follow this moral hope with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of all means, and ordinances, and in them reſolve to caſt himſelfe upon Chriſt to be ſaved by him in his own way, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own terms, why this hope may not be the immediate ground, if not the vehicle or chariot of the very firſt act of juſtifying faith. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>3ly. Let this hope produce <hi>waiting.</hi> Think not that thou art preſently caſt off by God, becauſe he doth not preſently (as to thy ſenſe) anſwer thy deſires. There is a great deal of <hi>impatience</hi> uſually in troubled ſpirits. And there is reaſon why ſuch ſouls ſhould be ſubject to that failing. For the wound of the ſpirit is an <hi>intolerable</hi> wound, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. And nothing is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to a man in intolerable pain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, then delays: <hi>Hear me ſpeedily,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>elſe ſhall I be like unto them that goe down into the pit, Pſalm</hi> 143. 7. and when God hides <hi>long,</hi> he apprehends it will be <hi>for ever, Pſalm</hi> 13. 1. But we muſt labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this corruption, and endeavour to bring our ſouls to a contentedneſſe <hi>to wait for</hi> Gods <hi>ſalvation,</hi> as long as he thinks fit to exerciſe and diſcipline us in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170084:82"/>

Now certainly this were a more likely way to ſpeed.</p>
               <p>8. Labour to <hi>keep your hearts warm,</hi> by keeping thoſe things moſt freſh upon your ſpirits by conſtant meditation, which moſt affect you. Thou goeſt home warm from a Sermon, affected (it may be) deeply with thy own condition by nature, or (it may be) convinced of the exceeding ſinfulneſſe of ſome Maſter ſin or other; when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt home, that this may be effectual to thy converſion, dwell upon thoſe paſſages in thy thoughts, and when they are ready to dye, recover them again by freſh recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſiring God to fix them upon thy ſpirit till they have done their work.

               <p>1] By wholly neglecting of them. For hereby a ſoul is expoſed to a million of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, whereunto a moderate proſecution of the affairs of a mans calling might prove a conſiderable diverſion. 'Tis true, I would have every ſoul upon the firſt ſmiting of his heart to ſet apart ſome time for a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation upon it, till he hath ſtated his condition, and (by Gods aſſiſtance beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Prayer) gained a clear ſight of his eſtate, brought his heart under ſuch fixed impreſſions, as will ſtick upon him through all his other imployments. After which he may go about the works of his calling moderately, and take ſet times out of it, to begin where he left laſt, ſo carrying on that work, yet not neglecting the other.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170084:87"/> As a Tradeſman takes time to ſtate his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and when ſo, falls to his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again; and having brought his Accounts into method, he can again find where he left.</p>
               <p>2] By over eager <hi>following</hi> them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. The cares of the world choak the Word. The Divel, when a ſoul ſets all its power on work to hunt him out, runs like a hare among a flock of ſheep; and ſo puzles the purſuing ſoul, and divers it. A man in ſuch a condition, if his neceſſary imployments cannot be carryed on by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, may and muſt follow them, yet he muſt take heed that his whole heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be let out in them; ſtil muſt the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Spirit of God run as a black thread through the whole web of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that when he hath gained time from his buſineſs to think on it more ſeriouſly, he miſs not his heart.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Avoid all cooling company,</hi> and chooſe thoſe whoſe affections are warmeſt, and their zeal hotteſt, provided they be ſound in the faith. This I have touched upon before (as alſo moſt of the reſt in a ſort) and therefore ſhall be but brief in it. When you are convinced, poſſibly your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany before conviction was meerly worldly, poſſibly vicious, drunken, diſſolute, now fly the very occaſions of converſing with them, and ſeek, cleave to, and eſteem only the company of the ſtricteſt. Theſe will be ſure

               <p>11. <hi>Keep no conſiderable paſſages of your preſent condition ſecret.</hi> O that I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade people, when the Word works any impreſſions upon their conſciences, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to let the ſame, or ſome other, but moſt chiefly, the ſame Miniſter that made the wound know it, and ſo afterwards give him an account of the carrying on or obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the work in all conſiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. How ſeaſonably might he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, preach, pray; and how ſutably apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them?</p>
               <p>12. <hi>Take ſpecial care of ſincerity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart in all your progreſſe this way.</hi> The heart oftentimes in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is afraid to appear as bad as it is, and therefore though for eaſe men will diſcover ſomething of their condition to a Miniſter or godly friend, yet it hath ever and anon an aptneſſe and diſpoſedneſſe to prevaricate and mince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O be ſure that you deal candidly and clearly in ſuch buſineſſes. And take heed leſt when you begin to find a change in your ſelves, you be tempted to <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 6</note> be willing to appear to Gods Miniſters or people better then you are, that you may get them to ſpeak peace to you, or eſteeme you the more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13 <hi>As you find improvements and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, labour to keep your hearts humble.</hi> It
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170084:88"/> may be, when you have confeſſed your ſins to God, and wept bitterly, and prayed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may find a kind of quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in your heart thereby; your wounds do not ake and ſmart as before, and you have an interval in your trouble, are prettily well pacified; but whence is it? is it not hence? Now you think you are in a faire way, ſure God will look on you now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore you riſe well pacified for the preſent. Take heed of this ſnare: Rather when you have ſo done, labor to riſe with the loweſt thoughts of what you have done, &amp; as long as you find ſuch a thought in you, never leave till you have prayed it downe. God cannot but be offended at ſuch thoughts as theſe. And this is one of the greateſt blocks in the way of ſaving grace that can be. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> James 4. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. I am confident this is the very thing that undoes many thouſand ſouls under ſuch workings of ſpirit. God ſees they begin to tye him to their performances, and therefore God leaves them to themſelves, and they either go away preſuming they have gotten what they ſought, and ſo all the work dies in a <hi>form of godlineſſe,</hi> or elſe if God ſave them, he lets them ſo cool again, that they ſee the former heat was meerly from him, and makes them beg hard for one of thoſe meltings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ere they can attain it. Rather on the other ſide, <hi>Humble your ſelves under the</hi>

                  </gap>o the hearts of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170084:89"/> People, it is by the <hi>Chariots of Ordinances and duties.</hi> But yet the ſpirit is a free agent. The <hi>ſaylor</hi> ſpreds his ſayles to receive the wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he can make no Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; But yet whether the wind wil fill them (at leaſt ſo as to further his Voyage) he cannot aſſure himſelf. When thou wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon the ſpirit in his Ordinances, thou doſt, as it were, ſpred thy ſailes, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit fill them, thou wilt make a good Voyage; if not, thy endeavours are nothing. Yet, as the ſaylor knowes he cannot command the wind, ſo he knows he muſt not therefore neglect to have his ſayles in a readineſſe to receive it when it blows: ſo it concerns thee to take care, that although the Spirit be not neceſſarily tied to Ordinances, yet thou do not therefore neglect attending them. Though the Spirit doe not alwayes come in that way, yet when he comes he will come in that way ordinarily? 'Tis a known ſtory, and the Application of it is no leſſe vulgar, of the poor man that waited at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> the water was the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> the Angel ſtirring it the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their healing. Had not the <hi>Angel come and ſtirred the water,</hi> they had waited in vain; but had they not <hi>waited</hi> there, the Angel would not have <hi>ſtirred the water,</hi> John 5. 3.</p>
               <p>When God hath appointed means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and converſion, it is a tempting of God to look for it in any way elſe with a neglect of thoſe means. 'Tis a ſad thing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170084:90"/> when people are of <hi>Naamans</hi> ſpirit (till hee was better adviſed) <hi>are not Abanah and Pharphar rivers of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>better then all the waters of Iſrael? may I not waſh in them and bee cleane?</hi> 2 King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 12. No, fooliſh man, thoſe Rivers are unſanctified Rivers, they are not ſet apart by God for that uſe, and therfore they wil do thee no good; ſo many thouſand ſouls cry now adaies, why ſhould we attend upon the word of God in publick, &amp; that from the mouth of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> (though ſome will ſcarce owne them now by that name) may I not as well profit, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by an <hi>honeſt tradeſman</hi> in a private houſe?</p>
               <p>I anſwer poſitively, <hi>no;</hi> for God having appointed means, and called men to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick officers to diſpenſe them for thy good, God will not go out of his way to meete thee: ſuch irregular wayes, are <hi>heaven-cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, heaven-blaſted waies,</hi> God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it long agoe. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 22, 32. when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets run upon their owne errands, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Lord ſent them, there is a curſe upon them, <hi>they ſhall do no good, they ſhall not profit this people at all, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And find mee any one ſeparated ſociety in the world, that ſlights and tramples upon publick ordinances; where there is any ſound converſion to Jeſus Chriſt, or any building up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in holineſſe, humility, ſelf-denial, &amp;c. or where the moſt that is gotten is not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and looſeneſſe, and that in ſome

But I dare confidently affirme that there is no ſuch ſociety to be found, which is not ſo bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God. And therefore, Friends, if ever you will have your hearts wrought upon, let publick ordinances be precious in your eyes.</p>
               <p>(2) You can commend your ſelves and your condition (before) to God in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that God will make the <hi>waters of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> healing waters to you, that he will give your ſouls a ſpecial and particular viſit in an ordinance, that he will not ſuffer your <hi>fleece to be dry,</hi> when others round about you are <hi>wet,</hi> that he will <hi>open your eyes, that you may ſee wonders out of his Law, Pſal.</hi> 119 18. and open your <hi>hearts,</hi> that you may <hi>feel</hi> them too, that you may not be <hi>dead</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or <hi>bare</hi> hearers; that the Law may not be a meer <hi>repreſenting glaſſe,</hi> to ſhew you the <hi>black-moors skin, and leopards ſpots;</hi> but an <hi>operating glaſſe,</hi> working your very hearts and ſoules to loath and abhor them, and fly to the <hi>fountaine opened in the Goſpel,</hi> for ſin <hi>and uncleanneſſe,</hi> to waſh them out. The reaſon why the word wounds ſo few, is this, People ſeldome or never lift up ſuch a prayer as this before they come, and therefore tis no wonder if they come and goe ſtones and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170084:91"/> blocks, and a convert (even when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is abundantly diſpenſed) bee as rare as a black Swan; that Gods Miniſters, and thoſe of the richeſt annointings every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they <hi>have laboured in vaine, and ſpent their ſtrength for nought, Iſa.</hi> 49. 4. in compariſon to what ſucceſſe there hath beene formerly to the labours of others.</p>

And when the heart is fixed on a buſineſſe, it is moſt likely to be <hi>affected.</hi> Tranſient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are quickly forgotten, but objects that are long in our eye, which we take a through view of, remain longer: Now I ſhal eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant here, that a natural man cannot by his longeſt dwelling upon ſuch a ſubject, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his owne heart; but I ſay ſtill, that hee may thereby put himſelfe into a poſiture
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170084:92"/> of ſoule as is moſt likely to be affected. The very reaſon why he T people but now ſpoken of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 32 did not make benefit of the word, was becauſe their <hi>hearts were after their covetouſneſs</hi> whilſt they ſate before the Lord. Gather in your ſtragling thoughts at ſuch a time, with conſiderations of this nature, that tis God ſpeakes; that the things he ſpeakes are of neareſt concernment to you, that you heare them now, and perhaps may heare them no more, this opportunity may be the laſt; or it may bee, however, this the laſt time that you may heare ſuch a Sermon, ſo cloſe, ſo particular; that if man thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, much more thy better, ſpake to thee a thing that concerned thee far leſſe, nay not at all, thou wouldſt in good manners hear and mind what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Minding</hi> what is thus preached; it is very hard, if thy memory (without much adoe with it) will not carry away ſomthing of what thou haſt heard; if not, I am ſure, to moſt it is an eaſie thing to helpe memory with their pens. And truly friends, let mee tell you this, if you were now at the barre to be tryed for your lives, you would, if you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted your memories, have your note book by you, and write down all material paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and if you could not your ſelfe, you would deſire ſome friend to helpe you; and ſhould you not take like care when the word of God is <hi>paſſing judgment</hi> upon your ſouls? I confeſſe, that if wee watch not over our

If bad, 'tis a great mercy to be convinced of it. &amp;c.</hi> Yet would I not in all theſe be miſunderſtood; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In all theſe I ſo affirm theſe acts to be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170084:95"/> in the power of the creature, as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the common, and ſometimes eſpecial influence of the Spirit upon them to produce them. It is in theſe actions as in thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rational acts of ours concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World, which are in the power of nature to perform, but yet the Spirit of God always in a common, but ſometimes in an eſpecial way draws out thoſe acts, ſo as may be moſt for Gods glory and our good, ſo though it be in the power of Nature to go to Church, and ſit reverently, and hearken out a Sermon, yet that I go at ſuch a time, and that poſſibly much againſt the grain of mine own inclination, that I obſerve ſuch and ſuch truths, and lay them up, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on them when I come home, &amp;c. more then others, this is the Spirits eſpecial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>i. e.</hi> by way of gifts, for in all this there may be no grace. It may be of very great uſe many times to obſerve, how in our common motions and actions about ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, there is many times a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ordering, and a particular influence of the Spirit exciting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In all this I imply not any <hi>neceſſity of connexion</hi> nor tye between theſe <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> Nor therein do I any way ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who tell us, that if we uſe nature well, and doe its utmoſt, God is bound <hi>ex congruo,</hi> to give grace. For there is no promiſe in Scripture that ties God to any meerly natural or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170084:95"/> act of ours, but onely to gracious acts; and all thoſe promiſes which reſpect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of ours, ſuppoſe the firſt grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given. And when God therefore makes promiſes to hearing, reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either thoſe acts muſt be gracious, or elſe they muſt be interpreted thus, <hi>Do you ſuch duties, follow ſuch means, and if ever I ſave you, I will meet you onely in that way. I will give as many as belong to the election of grace power to believe &amp;c. through praying, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meditation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thence it is that thoſe promiſes are not fulfilled to al that perfrom theſe actions. Becauſe though God have made ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of giving grace in ſuch a way, yet it runs not in this ſenſe, <hi>I will give grace to all that hear, pray, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas promiſes that are made to grace are univerſal. <hi>He is rich to al that call upon him, i. e.</hi> graciouſly, <hi>whoſoever beleeveth ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. Rom.</hi> 10. 12. ſo 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe acts are meer natural acts, <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> and therefore they can have no moral influence on God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet muſt we note for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that although God (in truth) be not bound to any mans endeavours, but is as free to give and deny grace, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of them: yet <hi>God ſeldom, if ever, hath been obſerved to fail</hi> any in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace from him, doing, in the way of means, what they by the power of nature
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170084:96"/> can, and the Spirit of God moves them unto.</p>
               <p>So, that no man ever periſhed under the enjoyment of ſuch means, but he may juſtly ſtop his mouth before God, and ſay, I juſtly periſh, notwithſtanding my impotency to do my duty, and Gods decree of not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing me ſufficient grace for converſion; becauſe I have done leſſe towards the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it then I could. For who knows, or how knew I, that God would not have given me ſufficient grace had I done my utmoſt, though notwithſtanding he was abſolutely free to deny me.</p>

               </p>
               <p>2. What reaſon haſt thou to expect, that God ſhall go out of his <hi>ordinary rode way</hi> to meet thee in thy <hi>by-paths?</hi> Hath God made thee any promiſe more then to others? Hath he excepted thee by name in thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in which he hath required attendance on his Ordinances? Haſt thou obliged him by any courteſie to take extraordinary pains with thee? If thou canſt plead nothing more
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170084:97"/> then another; then think rather, if God have left thouſands to periſh without calling them in an extraordinary way, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ordinary, why not me?</p>
               <p>3. Take this for a certain rule, God never condeſcended to do an extraordinary work for the conviction and converſion of thoſe, who out of deſigne break themſelves off from the ordinary, that they may put him to the coſt of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed 'tis thought by ſome, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted by a ſigne from heaven, but if ſo, yet conſider they are in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed condition, that they are not capable of means in an ordinary way, and ſo totally prejudiced againſt the truth, that they do not out of deſigne reject that which they are convinced is Gods ordinary way of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to put God to the expence of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but they really think they are in the true way, and Ordinances profane, and truth errour.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, Though ſignes may occaſion their conviction of the truth of Chriſtian Religion, yet without all doubt their ſaving converſion in and by it, ſhall be in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary ſigne ſhall ſet home the light of the propheſies, and hiſtory of Chriſt crucified, and ſo be the occaſion, not the cauſe of their converſion. For they ſhall be convinced of their murthering, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Lord of glory, and they ſhall upon

               </p>
               <p>4. 'Tis contrary to thy principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence in other things. The market is the ordinary way to get food, thou wilt not neglect that on this ground: and ſo phiſick of health, &amp;c. Thou wilt not ſay, I need not go to the market to buy or ſell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion this weeke, thou wilt not open ſhop, &amp;c. becauſe God can provide for thy ſelfe and thy family in an extraordinary way. And no man when he is ſick will (except in a phrenſy) refuſe to admit the phyſician, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God can cure in a miraculous way, yea and raiſe the very dead. Why ſhould any man adventure his ſoul upon thoſe principles upon which he will not hazard his body or eſtate?</p>
               <p>5. When men will not wait upon God in his ordinary way of converſion, it is juſt with him to give them up to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a falſe and unſound converſion, under ſome extraordinary deluſive energy of Satan, and to miſtake that very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarineſſe of deluſion, for an extraordinary work of Gods Spirit. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>

If our Saviour Chriſt had a warrant from God, to caſt himſelfe down from the pinnacle, had there been no other way down, he would not have ſtood ſo much upon it, as he did, the <hi>promiſe of angelical protection</hi> would have ſecured him being in his way, which was Gods way. A man may adventure to caſt himſelfe into <hi>Hell it ſelfe,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> leapt into the Sea at Chriſts command, when God bids him, and yet come off as untouched by the fire and brimſtone, as the three children were in the <hi>fiery furnace.</hi> See <hi>Iſa</hi> 43. 2.</p>
               <p>2. If the cure be dangerous, yet the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is deſperate.

               <p>And (poſſibly) by this time ſome one or other who have gone along with me in the former Treatiſe, may be almoſt in the ſame maze of uncertainty; at leaſt if he be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer under the Spirit of Bondage himſelf; or if not, he may well be affected with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious itch of inquiry after the end of ſuch providences.</p>

               <p>Adoption <hi>is a gracious priviledge whereby the Elect of God, and they only are out of the ſpecial grace and good will of God the Father, made his children through Jeſus Chriſt, and entituled with him to the joint inheritance of all the priviledges belonging to the ſons of God both here and hereafter.</hi>

Brethren then they were as ſonnes to the ſame Father, i. <hi>e,</hi> by Adoption, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſt had no brethren; and children as ſons to that father by a derived adoption from and through him. And therfore <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>The whole family, i. e.</hi> the Church, (called the <hi>houſhold of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 19. <hi>and of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10.) <hi>is named from him.</hi> Named? what? Saints, children of God, &amp;c. from him, <hi>i. e.</hi> from their relation to him as the head of the Family.</p>
               <p>And remarkably clear is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30. God (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us that we ſhould be conformable to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his ſon.</hi> Wherin conſiſts this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?

               <p>4. The <hi>ſpecial or formal nature</hi> of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in our being <hi>admitted into a relation of ſonnes and daughters to God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Ye ſhall be my ſonnes and daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almighty.</hi> Now this relation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170084:104"/> (as I ſaid before) is no <hi>natural</hi> relation, but <hi>moral,</hi> depending upon the will of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adopting, and taken up upon ſpecial grounds perſwading thereunto. Therefore 'tis a love <hi>beſtowed upon us,</hi> and we are ſaid to be <hi>called the Sons of God.</hi> And yet it is <note place="margin">1 John 3 1.</note> not a meer relation <hi>ſecundum dici</hi> (as they ſay) for which there is no real foundation. This Adoption is attended with a ſpiritual and myſtical <hi>generation,</hi> and a <hi>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a divine nature,</hi> whereby we are moſt <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1 4.</note> really <hi>conformed to the image of his Sonne,</hi> as being begotten by him <hi>in his own likeneſſe:</hi> he being the <hi>brother</hi> of our <hi>nature,</hi> but the <hi>Father</hi> of our <hi>perſons,</hi> in that <hi>the ſeed of God abides in us.</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3. 9. And therefore the bond is not ſo looſe on both ſides, as ordinarily in humane adoptions it is, whence we are God the Fathers children (in a ſort) one degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. And as <hi>Jacob</hi> adopted his ſon <hi>Joſephs</hi> children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 5. So doth <hi>God</hi> his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s. We are the Fathers ſeed by Adoption, being Chriſts by juſtification and regeneration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>conſequent,</hi> or rather <hi>concomitant of this relation, is a title to the inheritance of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, both here and hereafter.</hi> For this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall relation hath more in it herein then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary relations of that kind among men, ſeeing here every <hi>child</hi> is an <hi>heire,</hi> and in that reſpect every Saint is a <hi>firſt borne,</hi> whoſe priviledge it is to inherit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. And therefore in this reſpect Saints are <hi>conformed to Chriſt,</hi> not only in <hi>Sonſhip</hi> by adoption,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170084:105"/> but in his <hi>primogeniture</hi> or <hi>firſt ſonſhip.</hi> As the Apoſtle very clearly and comfortably concludes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>If children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then heirs;</hi> heires, to whom? and what? <hi>heires of God, i. e-</hi> of all that is in God; for <hi>the Lord is the portion of his people, the portion of</hi> Jacob. Jer. 51. 19 <hi>and Coheirs with Chriſt,</hi> [ejusdem gloriae, <hi>but not</hi> ejusdem gradus] <hi>heires of the ſame glory with Chriſt, but not of the ſame degree and meaſure. Hee that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, ſhall ſit with mee in my Throne. Apoc.</hi> 3. 21. According to <hi>John</hi> 21. 17. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Apoſtle (and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our deſcent from Chriſt, before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 21, 22 23.</note> of) <hi>all things</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are yours.</hi> And then there followes a large inventory annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this generall deed of gift, <hi>whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas;</hi> all means, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>miniſters,</hi> for their ſpirituall growth and improvement; <hi>or the world,</hi> creatures of the world, men of the world; a Saint hath title to all the good that all the world can afford him, as far as 'tis good for him: <hi>or life</hi> (as long as he may do good with it) hee is ſure to live as long as ſhall be for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; or if life be for his diſadvantage, as it may bee, then <hi>death</hi> (where note, that even death is part of a Saints inheritance, part of his goods and chattels:) and to ſum all up, <hi>things preſent,</hi> all temporall, <hi>and things to come</hi> all eternal mercies. But how comes this title to be firme in Law? If a Chriſtian cannot prove his genealogy, then 'tis que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170084:105"/> but if he can, then <hi>jure haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> hee may make good his claime againſt all the Divels in hell, 'tis by entaile ſetled upon Chriſt and his ſeede, <hi>yee are Chriſts,</hi> deſcended from him, <hi>and Chriſts is Gods,</hi> the principal Donour, the Author of the relation, and he will never recal his bounty, never cut off the entaile. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
               <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this preliminary queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of Adoption. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond followes, which we ſhall caſt off to another Chapter.</p>

                  </list> The firſt of theſe is the moſt noble, as the ſource of all the reſt. All which depend on it, and in their proper order and ſeaſon flow from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hee is <hi>the bond of our union</hi> to Chriſt. Whence the Apoſtle argues, <hi>that if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, hee is none of his,</hi> Rom 8. 9. Thence wee are ſaid to bee <hi>juſtified by the ſpirit of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>i. e.</hi> by his uniting us unto Chriſt our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; and ſanctified alſo, being made an <hi>habitation of God through the ſpirit,</hi> Eph. 2. 22. And thence alſo is our regeneration, which accompanies, confirmes, and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth our adoption, expreſſed by our <hi>being horne of the ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Spirit it is, in his bleſſed operations, which is the <hi>ſeed of God in us, we have received of his ſpirit,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 13. So then in the firſt place he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes upon us the right of Adoption, as the moſt properworker of this union. And as our Faith is the inſtrument of union, ſo hee is the giver of faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Faith</hi> indeed, Divines ordinarily call an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> but 'tis but an improper inſtrument; for as all its efficacy depends upon the relation which it hath to Chriſt, as an hand is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make rich, when it receives a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170084:106"/> or layes hold on it when freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo it doth nothing at all on Gods part. But the Spirit is (in a ſenſe) a proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on both parts, applying both Chriſt to us, and us to Chriſt: Chriſt to us, by reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a promiſe to lay hold on, and us to Chriſt, by giving us an hand to lay hold on it, and reſt our ſouls upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee is the <hi>witneſſe of our Relation.</hi> And this work is principally ſet out to us in the verſe preceding that which is the ground of our diſcourſe. <hi>The Spirit alſo witneſſeth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>with our ſpirits, that we are the Children of God,</hi> Concerning the manner of the Spirits teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat hereafter; onely take notice now, that he is ſaid to witneſſe <hi>with our ſpirits, i. e.</hi> to ſay the ſame thing with our conſciences rightly informed of their condition. Thus he is a <hi>ſeal</hi> and an <hi>earneſt,</hi> not to confirm on <hi>Gods</hi> part, but to aſſure our legal title on <hi>our</hi> part, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <p>In the diſcharge of this work, he is <hi>the comforter,</hi> who <hi>takes of Chriſts and ſhews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 6. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>his people, i. e.</hi> not only ſaving <hi>truth</hi> in illumination, and ſaving <hi>grace</hi> in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and juſtification, but alſo <hi>ſpeciall light and comfort</hi> in manifeſtation of our intereſt in God through Chriſt; he takes the <hi>Deed</hi> by which Chriſt is made the adopted head of his family, and all the territories of heaven and earth are given to him, and his ſeed for ever, and ſhews it to the Saints, and bids
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170084:107"/> them cheer up, for though they be now poor and perſecuted, <hi>wandring in ſheep-skins and goat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>skins,</hi> hiding among wild beaſts in <hi>dens and holes of the earth;</hi> yet they are heirs to all that heaven and earth contains, and the time will come when this great eſtate ſhall come in hand; and therefore they ſhould lay out liberally upon their hopes at preſent, and throw away all theſe things in a kind of holy prodigality, when God calls for them, being aſſured that their future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance will make amends for all.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>aſſuring act</hi> of the Spirit, and differs from the former thus: there, hee barely diſcovers to us a promiſe, and ſtirres us up to adventure upon it upon general invitations: here he gives us an evidence, that that promiſe is ours, and enables us to make uſe of it by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is the <hi>Advocate of our Cauſe.</hi> And thus he is ſaid alſo in this Chapter to <hi>make interceſſion for us.</hi> When our title at any time comes under diſpute, or when any thing is detained from us which our relation and the evidences which confirm it entitles us unto, he enables us to ſue out our intereſt; or if any thing befal us unworthy the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, he helps us to <hi>write letters to our Father</hi> to complain of, and bemoan our condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27. And this is that that is principally intended in the Text, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the former, which is the ground
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170084:107"/> of this, the Spirit helps us to <hi>cry Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by aſſuring us that God is our Father, and putting us upon earneſt and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate requeſts to him, as the requeſts of children uſe to be to a tender and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Father. And this work of the Spirit is ſo frequent and conſtant in the Saints, that it is (in effect) attributed wholly to the Spirit; <hi>God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into our heart, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <label>Anſw.</label> To both I ſhall give this prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer: and then give a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to each by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit doth give <hi>all</hi> Gods Elect, at one time or other, a true, reall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable <hi>title</hi> to the grace of adoption, and all the priviledges belonging thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In <hi>juſtification,</hi> making application of the ſoul of every elect perſon to Chriſt, and of Chriſt to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>ſanctification,</hi> making them <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> by the application of cleanſing promiſes. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>For elſe two links of the chain next election would be broken. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated them he called, and whom he called, he juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the firſt work before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit doth work in all perſons, that are really converted, (whether in the method of a Spirit of Bondage, or no) at one time or other, ſo much <hi>perſwaſion of the love of God,</hi> as encourageth the ſoul to lay hold upon the promiſes of the Goſpel, and to lay claim to them, and to adventure the ſoul upon them. For this is the ground of that reliance by which the ſoul <hi>leans</hi> upon God, and <hi>hangs</hi> upon Chriſt for ſalvation, wherein the nature of juſtifying faith (in my judgment) doth conſiſt. But there is a difference between <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>particular aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring faith.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> is grounded only upon the free and unlimited offers of the Goſpel, which offers Chriſt and Salvation to all that receive him and come to him, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpells invitations to accept of it: <hi>that</hi> is grounded upon particular evidence, that we have already accepted of him, and thereby he is become ours, and we his, from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170084:109"/> of a true and ſaving reliance upon him.</p>
               <p>And this general perſwaſion ſo far em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens all Gods elect, that upon the warrant of that, they lay <hi>claim</hi> to God as <hi>their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> not as actually and aſſuredly ſo, but as one that hath offered himſelfe to that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will own it to thoſe that (upon that offer) claim it at his hands. Thence though they know not God to be their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they lay hands on him upon his free offer as engaged to be their Father, and ſo by frequent acts of relyance, grow up into aſſurance that he is ſo, when they find ſuch fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts of their reliance, as evidence a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between God and them. I know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods Saints do (and I think they ſhould) call God Father, when they ſcarce know whether they may be ſo bold or no, and ſpeed that way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if any one of Gods elect <hi>want</hi> the <hi>aſſuring</hi> teſtimonies of Gods Spirit, it is their <hi>own fault,</hi> ſeeing God holds it forth to them in many a precious promiſe. And if they dare not call God Father, it is becauſe through clouds of temptation and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they darken thoſe evidences which might demonſtrate their ſonſhip. For juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſanctification, if diſcovered, are ſure foundations of comfort, and aſſurance. Thence their condition is expreſt by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is not the extinguiſhing of light in the object, or in the eye, but clouding it.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:170084:109"/>
               <p n="4">4. Of thoſe that have this aſſurance and enlargement thereupon, very few or none keep it <hi>at all times alike,</hi> and can alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it on every occaſion. Great ſinnes, and great troubles &amp;c. may many times cloud, and ſometimes as to the act, blot out the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Adoption. Thus <hi>David</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. 12. A child ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended, may ſcarce dare call Father, whiles that guilt remains uncovered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even the high and heroical acts of <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring faith</hi> in Gods Saints are <hi>not always free from ſome mixture of doubting,</hi> elſe there were no difference between aſſurance, and plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory, or full aſſurance.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But to anſwer more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Elect of God have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently (when called) the particular aſſuring teſtimony of Gods Spirit, though <hi>even that</hi> belongs to them, becauſe of ſome obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that either from Satan, or their own hearts may be put in their way. A man may be long a child of God before he know himſelf to be ſo. There muſt in order of nature be the <hi>certitudo objecti,</hi> before <hi>certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo ſubjecti;</hi> for I can never be ſure of a thing before it is. And how long this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>I am juſtified,</hi> may be true before this, <hi>I know I am juſtified,</hi> I cannot tell, it may be divers years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An elect child of God (for any thing I
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170084:110"/> know, or to my utmoſt knowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reveals) may go to heaven without that particular actual aſſurance, or a particular confidence to addreſſe himſelf to God as his Father, otherwiſe then by claim (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;) for I conceive it is not eſſential to the having of eternal Life, to know that a man hath grace actually, but only to have thoſe things in him whence the evidence of the truth of grace may be to a clearer and more enlightened ſpirit diſcovered. Though it be ſaid, He that believeth not ſhall be damned, yet it is no where ſaid, he that knows not he believes, ſhall be damned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet is every ſuch elect child of God, <note place="margin">The reality of his relation to God produceth in a Saint thoſe fruits, even when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth not know them. As appears in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond troubles in Gods people after converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth thoſe acts not by its aſſuring, but uniting act.</note> carryed out after holineſſe, and obedience to God, by the ſecret ſeed of God, that is in him, by a <hi>natural inclination,</hi> I mean from the new nature; though he be not ſo viſibly acted by <hi>moral perſwaſion,</hi> or force of argument from graces received, as thoſe that ſee they have grace and are adopted, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually be. As in thoſe creatures that want reaſon, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And as Chriſt would not keep <hi>Lazarus</hi> from dying, when he could have done ſo; but rather choſe to raiſe him from the dead by a miracle: ſo will Chriſt deal with his people, quite bring them to the grave, that then he may get the glory of a kind of miracle, and ſay, <hi>Return ye ſons</hi>

The <hi>duties</hi> God expects of his Saints, which cannot be ſo <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>ingenuouſly</hi> performed by any, as by an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpirit. Indeed, the <hi>truth</hi> of them may proceed from a ſoul that is not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but ſuch <hi>high</hi> and <hi>noble meaſures</hi> cannot.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Love</hi> to him again. A man may, and every Saint doth love God by a holy <hi>ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:170084:113"/> as ſoon as he is regenerated, whether he know it or no; and the demonſtration of that love in the Saints, when they come to diſcerne it, becomes a means of aſſurance to them. As in <hi>Antipathies,</hi> ſometimes they are ſtrong in <hi>nature;</hi> and no reaſon can be given for them.
<q>Non amo te Sabidi, nec poſſum dicere quare, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </q> So in <hi>ſympathies,</hi> founded in the nature of the things. Why doth Iron love the Load-ſtone, and cleave to it, or the needle touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it point Northward? This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirm, that where the ſoul loves God, Gods love is the cauſe of that love to him; and ſo it is, whether it be manifeſted to his conſcience or no; becauſe every grace is a fruit of Gods eternal love. This I am ſure is held out in that excellent place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. though I ſhall not grant it a fruit thereof only when knowne. 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>Becauſe</hi> we are aſſured <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> but <hi>Becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> But yet the love that is without aſſurance, is not ſo ſtrong, ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ſo active, as that that proceeds from aſſurance, when the love of God is ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt; for this will enable a ſoul to <hi>love much, Luke</hi> 7. 47. to <hi>rejoice in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 5 and do many other difficult duties with more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and activity.</p>
               <p>A <hi>young child</hi> may truly love the Father,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170084:113"/> when it is unable to reaſon it ſelfe into the duty of love from experience of the Fathers love; but the love that a <hi>growne child</hi> ſhews to the father after his experience of many acts of love for many years, is more ſtrong, ſolid, and rational. So when a ſoul can ſay as <hi>David, I love the Lord, for,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 116 1</p>
               <p>Now God requires his children ſhould grow up into an ingenuous filial love, upon grounds of thankfulneſſe and reciprocation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18, 19 He would have them be rooted and grounded in the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>knowledg of the love of Chriſt,</hi> and thence to draw ſtrength to obey him in all things. And therefore it muſt needs be his ordinary way to thoſe Saints from whom he expects this fruit, to give them the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to teſtifie this Love to them. And there is a Promiſe, that <hi>love of good will</hi> to Chriſt, ſhall be ſeconded with <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of love from Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 16 Now although a ſoul may have ſome <hi>ſprinklings</hi> of joy upon the general hopes which it gathers to it ſelf from <hi>general Promiſes,</hi> yet it is nothing to that whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>particular aſſurance</hi> gives. Now God will have the joy of his Saints full joy, <hi>John</hi> 15. 11. And good reaſon, <hi>for the joy of the Lord is their ſtrength,</hi> Nehem. 8. 10. Though God bear ſomtimes with their weakneſs as well as darkneſs.</p>

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Thankfulneſſe.</hi> Indeed there is a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ariſing from <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>common</hi> mercies, and there is a thankfulneſs for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>comprehenſive Promiſes, and free offers of Chriſt and Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. before Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170084:117"/> point of immediate evidence; yet I cannot be perſwaded, but that there is ſomething in the work of the Spirits teſtimony, which may deſerve to be ſo expreſſed.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Immediately:</hi> wherein the Spirit acts as in <hi>illumination</hi> and <hi>infuſion</hi> of good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into us by his ſecret influence upon the heart, quieting and calming all thoſe waves of diſtruſt and diffidence concerning its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by his own immediate power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſent application of any Scripture grounds to convince a mans reaſon that his teſtimony is true. I ſhall parallel it with the <hi>motions of the Spirit</hi> thus; As the Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times excites a man to ſuch or ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by laying his hand immediately upon the heart, and therewithal a kind of <hi>ſecret force and power,</hi> inclining the heart to obey thoſe motions; and as it many times opens the heart to ſuch and ſuch ſpiritual impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by a phyſical injection of holy motions into it, and warming the heart to receive them: ſo in this caſe when a poor ſoul ſits in darkneſſe and ſees no light, ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden a light from heaven compaſſeth it about, and it is, it knowes not how, in a moment (as it were) <hi>taken up into the third heaven,</hi> its fears are baniſhed by a ſoft whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from the Spirit of God in the heart, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee;</hi> and this is in ſuch a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170084:118"/> way, that though the ſpirit of a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believes it, and is immediately calmed by it, yet it cannot tell how it comes to paſſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is ſometimes in <hi>overcoming temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> a ſoule ſome other times is enabled to <hi>knock</hi> them to the ground by a <hi>ſcriptum eſt,</hi> (as Chriſt did <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.) but ſometimes it is ſtirred up to decline them, and abhorre them, by a ſecret riſing of the ſpirit againſt them, and to <hi>club</hi> them downe by <hi>meere force,</hi> ſetting the bent of the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt them, without any preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect recourſe of the ſoule to the written word. And of this kinde, is that worke of the Spirit, ſtirring up in us <hi>ſighes and groans</hi> in prayer, <hi>that cannot bee uttered;</hi> whereas at other times it furniſheth us with abundant matter of prayer from the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other ſtraines of Scripture, uſeful thereunto.</p>
               <p>And thus (as I ſaid) in conveying the evidences of Gods love, the Spirit can, and ſurely oftentimes doth alter the whole frame of a mans Spirit by a ſecret irradiation of comfort, a man cannot tell how: for as there is a kind of ſpiritual <hi>inſtinct</hi> in the ſoul by which it doth the <hi>things</hi> that are pleaſing to God, after converſion, though many times it knowes not the <hi>principles</hi> upon which it acts: ſo is there a ſecret and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual faculty in the <hi>divine nature</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed unto us, by which when the Spirit
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170084:118"/> ſpeakes peace to the ſoule, it cloſeth with it without any reaſoning or recourſe to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, as at other times. As (ſaith a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man) there is in the eye, <hi>lumen innatum,</hi>

                     <hi>Rutherf.</hi> on Jo. 12. p. 100.</note> and in the eare, <hi>aer internus,</hi> a certaine <hi>imbred light,</hi> to make the eye ſee lights and colours without: and a <hi>ſound and air in the eare within,</hi> to make it diſcerne the ſounds that are without; ſo is there grace, a new nature, and habitual inſtinct of heaven to diſcerne the conſolation of Gods ſpirit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately teſtifying that wee are the ſons of God. There are ſome ſecret and unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible lineaments of the Fathers countenance in this child, that the renewed ſoul at firſt bluſh, knowes, and ownes it. But for the underſtanding of this, you muſt obſerve with mee theſe few particulars for expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this ſecret of experimentall godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>1. That although the Spirit may teſtifie this immediately, <hi>without</hi> any expreſſe and formall application of a word; yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teſtifies but <hi>according to the word, i. e.</hi> to <hi>ſubjects</hi> capable thereof, and in ſuch <hi>wayes</hi> as they are diſcovered to be capable by the word: ſo that the Lords <hi>ſpeaking peace</hi> to the ſoul, being in the Scripture bound up to perſons under certain qualifications, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit never ſpeaks peace, but where thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are real, though not alwaies viſible in the ſoule. As for example, if a man that feels not ſin a burden heavyer then all the world,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170084:119"/> that throwes away all duties of religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prayes, reads, heares, meditates, nay goes on in ſome ſinful way without remorſe, be filled with joy and peace, and aſſurance of Gods love; 'tis certaine the Holy ſpirit is not the Author of this, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of peace, belongs to none of this ſtamp, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Undoubtedly this aſſurance is from the <hi>ſpirit of errour,</hi> a falſe light to lead into a bogg.</p>
               <p>2. That (ordinarily) hee thus teſtifies either <hi>in</hi> or <hi>after</hi> waiting upon God in ſome <hi>duty</hi> or other, as in praying, meditation, hearing, receiving the Sacraments. By which teſtimony God ſeals to the dutifull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon him in ſuch waies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. and 56. 7.</p>
               <p>Or 3. In ſuch great and grievous <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and darkneſſe of ſpirit, wherein a man by the cunning of Satan, hath ſo <hi>intangled</hi> all thoſe <hi>evidences</hi> of grace and ſanctification which hee might draw aſſurance from, with ſophiſtical evaſions, that they will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten any thing of comfort upon him. Then when a man cannot <hi>untie</hi> thoſe <hi>knots,</hi> by which Satan hath entangled his ſpirit, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſpirit of God by ſuch a ſudden ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation puts a ſoule upon an <hi>inartificial</hi> and <hi>illogicall</hi> way of ſolution, enabling him to hold to his claime of Chriſt, by a kind of reſolute confidence, though hee bee not able to prove it ſound at preſent, or anſwer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170084:119"/> ſophiſtry to the contrary; as <hi>Alexander,</hi> when hee could not untie the <hi>Gordian knot,</hi> hewed it aſunder with his ſword: And as that holy Martyr, that anſwered all the Romiſh Doctours Sophiſtry, by a fixed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>dying</hi> for Chriſt, though ſhee could not <hi>diſpute</hi> for him.</p>
               <p>Now wee muſt take notice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>4. That ſuch teſtimonies of the Spirit do beget but an <hi>actual aſſurance</hi> during the <hi>preſent exigency,</hi> or in order to ſome <hi>preſent deſigne</hi> that God is working thereby. Theſe are extraordinary dainties, that God will not have us feed conſtantly upon. <hi>A gleam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rutherf. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prà.</note> 
                  <hi>of light</hi> (as one calls it) in a dark night, when a man cannot coaſt the Country, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeern his way by thoſe marks which direct him at other times; perhaps <hi>lightning from a thunder-cloud,</hi> that comes juſt in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when a man is ſtepping into a pit that would ſwallow him up, or to diſcover a cottage which he may turne into, till the ſtorme bee over, &amp;c. Now a Traveller wil not depend alwaies upon ſuch a guide, but if hee can, will learne out ſuch way-marks for his conſtant direction, as may bee ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſſurances to him that hee is in the way; and rather chooſe to travel by day, when hee may ſee them diſtinctly. Thus though Gods Spirit divers times takes this courſe, to ſhine peace into our hearts upon unuſual occaſions immediately, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170084:120"/> ſeeking God in duty, under the immediate violence of ſome deſperate temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (in which caſes God hath ſometimes condeſcended even to a <hi>kind of miracle;</hi> as when he preſerved the <hi>glaſſe from breaking,</hi> which the troubled and almoſt deſpairing Gentlewoman threw againſt the ground, making its breaking to pieces, and her owne <note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Honymood</hi>
                  </note> damnation a like certaine) or at the houre of death, eſpecially Martyrdome; yet to take theſe for ordinary preſidents, and look for them conſtantly, without endeavouring by ſtanding evidences, to make out an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual aſſurance to our ſoules of our calling and election, is a bold and preſumptuous tempting of God. And therefore,</p>
               <p>5 It is a fearful error of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> which teacheth us to reject the graces of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification from being grounds of our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; whiles they tell us, that they are all <hi>deceiving evidences,</hi> becauſe that were to <hi>light a candle to the ſun,</hi> (they mean to the <hi>immediate teſtimony of the Spirit.)</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the teſtimony of the Spirit, cannot bee without the <hi>indwelling of the Spirit,</hi> and is accompanied alwaies with the <hi>leading</hi> of the Spirit. See the connexion of theſe two in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. 15 of this chapter, compared. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14, 15 compared.</note> And, <hi>wee know that hee dwelleth in us, and we in him, becauſe wee have received of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 13. And <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17 Chriſt promiſeth them the Comforter: but how ſhall wee know him, might they ſay? ſeeing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170084:120"/> the <hi>world</hi> (as you tel us) <hi>knows him not. He ſhal</hi> (ſaith our Savior) <hi>dwel in you.</hi> The <hi>in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> therfore of the Spirit, is an evidence of the truth and reality of the aſſurance that we have from the Spirit: Hence are all thoſe marks and ſignes that the Scripture every where holds out, called <hi>fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. ſo that though the Spirit teſtifie <hi>immediately,</hi> yet it ſubmits the trial of his own teſtimony to his <hi>works;</hi> Nor is this any diſhonour to the Spirit, to be tryed by his works, ſeeing our Saviour Chriſt was content to ſubmit the trial of his Godhead to the evidences of his works. <hi>John</hi> 14. 11.</p>
               <p>But more of this in the ſecond way of the Spirits teſtimonie, which is,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Mediately,</hi> and that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>Without</hi> Argumentation.</item>
                     <item>2 <hi>With</hi> Argumentation.</item>
                  </list> but both from the Word.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Without Argumentation:</hi> The Spirit ſometimes applies the word to the ſoule, and enables the ſoule to cloſe with it for comfort in ſome particular promiſe of Scripture; wherein God ſpeaks <hi>ſo patt</hi> to its caſe, that it takes that word as a meſſage from heaven, and reſts in it, upon the very firſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: And ſuch is the peace that a ſoul gets from thoſe promiſes that either expreſſe not <hi>any</hi> condition, or elſe <hi>ſuch</hi> a condition as the ſoul preſently apprehends it ſelf under: as ſuppoſe, thou art burthened for ſome ſin,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170084:121"/> haſt prayed earneſtly for pardon againſt it; ſuppoſe it a ſin of <hi>backſliding,</hi> and whiles thou art praying for pardon, or waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in his word, a ſecret whiſper of the Spirit caſts into thy heart, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 14. <hi>I will heale thy backſlidings, and love thee freely;</hi> or ſuppoſe that <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come to mee all yee that are heavy laden, and I wil give you reſt, &amp;c.</hi> This is a direct teſtimony, and muſt be underſtood under the former limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>immediate evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With Argumentation,</hi> when he teſtifies the truth of thy <hi>ſonſhip</hi> by grace, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies conditional promiſes, and upon ſearch enables thee to apply the conditions of them. This is the uſuall way for getting <hi>habitual aſſurance,</hi> a reflected teſtimony from our owne graces, which are the <hi>love-tokens of Chriſt</hi> to us, and diſcover that love even when, as to preſent influence, hee is abſent from us.</p>
               <p>And thus doth the Spirit (properly) <hi>witneſſe with our ſpirits,</hi> as followes in the next <hi>verſe.</hi> In the other two hee witneſſeth <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>to our ſpirits;</hi> in this properly, <hi>with our ſpirits.</hi> And there is as much difference between theſe, as between the aſſurance that <hi>Jacob</hi> had of his Son <hi>Joſeps</hi> life, from the <hi>Word</hi> of his ſonnes, and from the <hi>Chariots</hi> that hee had ſent for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 26, 27, 28, when they only <hi>told</hi> him ſo, hee was (indeed) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed, but was alſo even in a <hi>fainting</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:170084:121"/> condition through the ſtrugling of <hi>fear</hi> with <hi>joy,</hi> as the diſciples at Chriſts reſurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 41. But when he ſaw the wagons, then hee was <hi>fully ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the immediate and direct Teſtimony of the Spirit (though ſometimes when the Spirit gives a man to believe it, it may drowne all doubts and feares, yet) in a time of temptation, when a ſoule begins to queſtion whether all its former refreſhments from the Spirit were not dreames and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is never ſo fully ſatisfied, as when it evidently ſees and ownes the tokens of Gods love in its owne heart, the fruits of her marriage with Chriſt, and feels the <hi>child</hi> of grace <hi>leaping in the womb:</hi> then ſaith the ſoule, ſure I am married to Chriſt, for hee doth not <hi>drink waters out of any ciſterne</hi> but <hi>his owne,</hi> and the ſeed of true grace cannot poſſibly bee the iſſue of an unlawfull bed.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>Conviction of Goſpel:</hi> For as the <hi>law,</hi> the <hi>bondwoman,</hi> from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is the ground of terrour, engendring unto bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. So the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>the Jeruſalem from above,</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders to <hi>liberty, ibid.</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170084:123"/> ſo is the ſpecial ground of comfort. The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>warrant</hi> upon which the ſpirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſons the conſcience; and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> the <hi>warrant</hi> on which it releaſeth it againe. And as it is in civill affaires; a man that is under an execution for body and goods by ſuch or ſuch a ſtatute, hides, and flies, and is under feare, and ſometimes laid faſt in priſon, and cannot bee releaſed, but either upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of that law, or the annexing ſome condition to it, under which hee ſues for, and recovers his liberty; ſo it is in this caſe. The Law ſayes, <hi>every one is accurſed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues not in every thing written in that booke. No fornicator, idolater, covetous, &amp;c. ſhal enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> Now a man that is under the ſentence of this law in his own conſcience is capable of releaſe no way, but either by the repeale of that Law, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome ſuch limitation, or reſtriction, or condition to it, as may include him. Therefore when the Spirit gives peace from the word by way of Argument, it firſt produceth <hi>the law of liberty,</hi> the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law <hi>of bondage.</hi> It is confeſt, (ſaith the ſpirit in the conſcience of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner) the law gives mee no hope; but there is an addition to, and an exception from that law, which I plead for my releaſe. There is a pardon proclaimed for ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as I am. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. The Law in the <hi>new edition</hi> excepts believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 26 from its ſentence.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:170084:123"/>
               <p>Now the apprehending and aſſenting to this truth, is the firſt work of the ſpirit in order to this regular aſſurance of a mans heart before God. A man in a ſtate of ſpiritual darkneſſe, is like <hi>Hagar</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 19.</note> ſhe and her ſonne <hi>Iſmael,</hi> are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye for thirſt, when there was a well near them, but they could not ſee it till the Angel ſhewed it them. So is it in the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Law,</hi> that <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſhadowed out. When they are under Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſpirit, there be many precious wells of ſalvation in the Bible, but all theſe are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from their eyes, the Bible is a <hi>ſealed book</hi> to them, and the fountains of life are <hi>fountains ſhut up</hi> (as to them) till the ſpirit that leads into all truth direct a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſuch a caſe to ſuch promiſes as may be a ground of peace to him, that may <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the weary ſoul, and refreſh the ſorrowfull ſoul.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I appeal to the experience of all the Saints of God that know what this means, whether the Spirit of God hath not many times guided them to places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as it were) by his own finger. When they have even thrown the Bible away, after much ſearch for a comforting word, and reſolved to look no more for that that is not to be found there, hath not a ſecret whiſper, (like that to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>tolle, lege)</hi> been caſt into them <hi>try once again?</hi> and have they not unexpectedly
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170084:124"/> dipt and lighted on a place that hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied them <hi>as with marrow and fatneſſe?</hi> Hath it not been with them, as with a <hi>godly Miniſter</hi> that I knew when I was a child, who having been under a Spirit of Bondage for many years, and now even ready to dye in that condition, when the eighth chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> was read to him a little before his laſt gaſpe, ſtopping at the firſt verſe, <hi>now there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Stay, ſaid he, I never ſaw ſo much in thoſe words in my days as now, though I read them often: ſo (I ſay) can you not ſay that you have read ſuch and ſuch chapters, ten, twenty, thirty, forty times over, (and that not ſlightly or curſorily, but deliberately and with meditation) and yet could ſee never a well of Salvation in them, and yet afterwards from thoſe very places of Scripture the Spirit of God hath made you <hi>draw water with joy!</hi> So that 'tis the Spirit that doth this firſt work, diſcover and convince of Goſpel truth, the ground of our aſſurance. Now this conviction is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>General,</hi> and ſo the ſoul is convinced of thoſe very truths long before it can take comfort from them, and believes them with ſuch a faith as he believes the Bible to be true in every part of it: and this appears in thoſe that are under a Spirit of Bondage.

               <p>(2) <hi>Conviction of Caſe:</hi> Thus the Spirit enlightens the conſcience to apply the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> to its ſelf by owning the <hi>condition</hi> of it.

But in the ſoul that is graciouſly aſſured this way, the Spirit of God reſts the heart upon an <hi>ultimum quod ſic,</hi> convinceth him by that which is moſt viſible in him, and ſtops the mouth of cavilling reaſon from perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queſtion any more. As a <hi>wiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator</hi> in a Diſpute, that when the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been ſpun out ſo long by a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling companion, that there can be no more
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170084:126"/> ſaid, but in away of groundleſſe cavilling, and angry reflections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> breaks off the Diſpute, checks the wrangling <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> and determines the Controverſie by his own ſentence upon the whole matter. So when a mans own cavilling heart, and Satan help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, have picked out all the flawes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in his evidence for heaven, and have left no ſtone unturned to invalidate it, and withal the Spirit hath enabled a man to plead to all exceptions of moment, and yet theſe <hi>wrangling companions</hi> will not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at laſt the Spirit makes a man to ſee, that there is nothing can be ſaid that hath not been anſwered, but only ſuch wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as deſerve no anſwer but ſcorn, and ſo determines, and enables the ſoul to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the great Queſtion, by inferring the concluſion with undenyable evidence. I know not why this way (the Spirit of God aſſuring) ſhould not be leſſe ſubject to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, then <hi>immediate aſſurance.</hi> Seeing in a time of darkneſſe, that is as queſtionable, and will require as long a debate to ſatisfie the ſoul, whether indeed it were the voice of the Spirit, or a mans owne heart, and Satan colluding with it to deceive a man. Let any man ſhew mee that 'tis eaſier for a man to be certainly convinced, that the Spirits immediate teſtimony is true, and proceeding from the Spirit, then that ſuch and ſuch fruits of grace (the matter of its mediate teſtimony) are not counterfeit, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170084:126"/> I have done preſſing this Argument any more.</p>
               <p>3 The third thing the Spirit doth, is to infer the <hi>concluſion</hi> of the grand Syllogiſme, in a <hi>conviction of a gracious and happy eſtate;</hi> thus: therefore, <hi>Thou art a child of God, an heir of glory, juſtified, ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. (For all theſe termes and many more are of equal import to the caſe in hand; the concluding any thing in a man that neceſſarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſalvation, concludes the certainty of ſalvation to that perſon, and ſeals up aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.) In the <hi>former</hi> two acts, the Spirit is the <hi>candle of the Lord, without</hi> a man, in pointing out the word; and <hi>within</hi> a man, in the application of his caſe to the Word; and in this he acts the part of a juſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of the controverſie upon this evidence, a Judg in the conſcience quitting and juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priſoner; and this is his <hi>ſentence of Abſolution,</hi> and therefore when it is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Miniſters (as moſt commonly it is) 'tis called, <hi>looſing</hi> the conſcience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18, 19. And this I cal conviction of a gracious and happy eſtate, which is oppoſite to that conviction of a wicked and wretched eſtate, diſcovered in the concluſion of the legal Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm before mentioned.</p>
               <p>4 The <hi>Effects</hi> of this Teſtimony when it is finiſhed, are quite contrary to the former of the Spirit of Bondage.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The <hi>ſupporting teſtimony</hi> of the Spirit is ſuch a witneſſe in a mans heart, as in a grievous <hi>plunge</hi> of temptation, keeps him from <hi>ſinking,</hi> a <hi>plank</hi> in a deſperate ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack that ſaves him from <hi>drowning.</hi> And it is ordinarily the laſt refuge of a ſoul: when Satan hath quite conquered Aſſurance, then the Spirit acts that ſoul by a faith of relyance wherein he doth <hi>petere principium,</hi> in a good ſenſe, acts faith, as at firſt in Juſtification. <hi>Well</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>if I am no Believer, if I am no lover of God, if I be a Formaliſt, an hypocrite; yet there is faith, repentance, love, ſincerity for me in Chriſt, and God offers it freely and unconditionately, I will ſtay my ſelf upon thoſe Promiſes or gracious declarations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Abſolute Promiſes may be and are the ground of the Spirits ſupporting te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But ſecondly, There is an aſſuring te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Spirit, that that a Chriſtian lives by in calm and clear times, and trades by; that whereby we are ſaid, to <hi>know that God dwells in us and we in him,</hi> 1 John 4. 13.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170084:129"/> Therein the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to come in the Goſpel in much Aſſurance. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with a full ſail of peace and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſatisfaction; ſo that not only all doubtings are removed, but all the grounds on which a man doubts are ſatisfied. There is as much difference between theſe two acts of the Spirit, as there is between ſuch a plea as diverts a judgment againſt a man at preſent, and that wherein by an evident deed or writing, it is certainly determined on his ſide.</p>
               <p>And ſo we may diſtinguiſh <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> For though Comfort alwayes follow Aſſurance, ſo that there can be no <hi>aſſurance</hi> but it muſt <hi>comfort,</hi> yet where ever there is comfort, it followes not there muſt be Aſſurance. For there may be comfort in a <hi>leſſe evil</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with a <hi>greater;</hi> and a poor ſoul may take comfort in this, that although he be not ſure he is <hi>included</hi> in the Promiſe, yet he is not <hi>excluded;</hi> but Aſſurance preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth an actual perſwaſion, that a man hath a ſhare in the Promiſe. A man may be comforted with this, that although it is <hi>bad</hi> with him now, yet it may be better; but Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ſuppoſeth a ſenſe of his good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at preſent.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this diſtinction to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Queſtion propounded, I am not ſatisfied that any man can draw Aſſurance, as it is thus diſtinguiſhed from ſupport and comfort, from an Abſolute Promiſe, becauſe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170084:130"/> an Abſolute Promiſe is no legal plea for me in particular, as to my preſent Title to God though it be for my future hopes of ſuch a Title. And my ground is this, <hi>That which all are called upon to believe, and which is offered to all alike, cannot be a grounded plea to put a diſtinction between me and others. but particular Aſſurance puts a ſpecial Mark of diſtinction between me and others; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſes are offered to all alike; and therefore Aſſurance cannot flow from an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe.</hi> Nay let me add, it is the conſtant guiſe of <hi>Preſumption</hi> to plead Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſes in point of Evidence, as the Promiſe of giving <hi>Chriſt to dye for ſinners,</hi> and therefore they are confident he is theirs as well as others. All that Gods <hi>Saints</hi> draw from hence is a comfortable ground of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to Chriſt, with conſtancy and perſeverance, becauſe the Spirit teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to them, that they are capable of the mercy that is held forth in ſuch Promiſes, if they ſo adhere to them, and leave not to urge God with them. And the caſe is the ſame with general offers: Gods general Offers and abſolute Promiſes are of the ſame nature in this caſe. Both may ſupport, comfort a man for the preſent, but are no evidences for the future.</p>
               <p>As a Prince proclaimeth an Act of Grace, an Act of Pardon and Oblivion to <hi>Traitors,</hi> and invites in general terms all perſons to come and receive it upon ſuch and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170084:130"/> among the reſt, one that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends himſelf more guilty then all others, doubts whether it ſhall reach to him or no, he comes into ſuch a Market and hears the Proclamation to all Traitors <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; hereby is the man ſo far quieted and ſupported with this newes; <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I hear I am not excluded, I am not unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> But now if this man go no farther, but a while after come to tryal of Law for his Treaſons, and he thinks to plead the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proclamation and the mercy of the Prince, extending it ſelfe to all Malefactors, will this ſerve for a Legal evidence to a Jury, that he is a pardoned man? Will it not be asked, Sir, What Evidence have you, that you laid down your Arms and accepted this pardon? Here now is required another kind of teſtimony.</p>
               <p>So here: God proclaims mercy in Chriſt to the greateſt ſinners, and this he declares to proceed from his vaſt and unſpeakable love, and therupon invites all ſinners to come and accept of it, for he is a <hi>God merciful and gracious, abounding in mercy and truth, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>will abundantly pardon returning ſinners.</hi> Now a poor ſoul doubts, whether he be included in this offer. Doubt it not, ſaith the Spirit, in a Sermon or other Ordinance; be of good cheer, man, the pardon offered concerns all. Now if a man reſt here, and believe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that he is pardoned, becauſe in Gods abſolute and unconditioned invitation he is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170084:131"/> not excluded; when conſcience is awake, it will ſay, <hi>But might not</hi> Judas <hi>and</hi> Cain, <hi>&amp;c. plead as much as that? How can you make it appear that you have accepted that pardon by Faith?</hi> Here need Marks and conditional Promiſes.</p>
               <p>I may plead abſolute Promiſes, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offers to God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> but I cannot plead them before God in <hi>Court.</hi> God ſaith <hi>I will give you a new heart; I will powre out the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication:</hi> and ſo in <note place="margin">Zech 12. 10</note> general offers, <hi>Let whoever will, come and drink of the water of life freely.</hi> I may go to <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 17</note> God on theſe Promiſes and Offers, and ſay, <hi>Lord give me a new heart, Lord give me Chriſt.</hi> But if I ſtand before the Court of Conſcience and plead theſe in way of Evidence, <hi>That I have a new heart, that I have Chriſt,</hi> I muſt not prove it by Gods promiſing theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in general to me with all others, but by the Evidences of my acceptance of theſe Offers, and Gods fulfilling of theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I muſt be able to ſay here, <hi>Lord thou haſt made ſuch offers, and my heart hath accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. Thou haſt tendred Chriſt unto me, and I have taken him upon thine own terms; Thou haſt promiſed a new heart, and I bleſſe thy name I find my heart renewed. Are not theſe the badges and proper cognizances of thy children and ſervants? May I not conclude a ſaving intereſt in thee, who have received ſuch ſaving mercies and bounties from thee?</hi> Thus have I ſhowen you, that (although general

It is a great encouragement to a ſick man, though hee be grievouſly pained at preſent, that his diſeaſe is ſuch, out of which moſt recover; that though <hi>ſometimes</hi> it be, yet <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> it is mortal.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. Obſerve the policy of Satan in dealing with thy ſoule. Now hee hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>an oar into the ſpirits boat.</hi> Thou maiſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne him by his uſual guiſe of tempting; which is to direct thee from the ſtudy and care of things <hi>revealed,</hi> to things <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>uncertaine.</hi> In mens unregeneracie, when they wallow in ſin ſecurely, the word threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens curſes and wrath againſt them, ſee then how Satan withdrawes them from the ſtudy of, and ſurrendring their hearts unto the power of that word by a falſe prophecie. <hi>I ſhal have peace. Deut.</hi> 29 19. I may <hi>live many a fair day yet, and repent, and die a child of God. Ye ſhal not die, Gen.</hi> 2. And ſo he drives men to <hi>preſume.</hi> And if I be elected (ſaith ſuch a wretchleſſe ſinner) I ſhal be ſaved at the laſt, let me walke how I will in the meane while. But I hope I am not a reprobate &amp;c. (will ſuch an heart bee apt to aſſume) and the iſſue is a reſolution to continue in ſinne, and put it upon the adventure. But when a ſoul is under a Spirit of bondage, he turns his note; but how is it? Is it not the ſame plot new dreſſed? Now he propheſies an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter irrecoverableneſſe to thy condition, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170084:132"/> upon what ground? why, (forſooth) hee hath looked over Gods <hi>booke of life,</hi> and hee cannot find thy name there, and therefore do what thou wilt, thou canſt hope for no better, but worſe rather then what thou now feeleſt. He will not ſuffer thee now to conclude at the ſame rate as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that thou hopeſt thou art not a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but maiſt (for any thing thou knoweſt, be elected as well as any other.</p>
               <p>The only remedy thou haſt in ſuch caſes, is to conſult the <hi>written Word</hi> of God. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſaith thou art not elected, but is there any <hi>Mark</hi> in the whole Word of God, by which a man may know he is <hi>not Elected?</hi> No; God in his infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath not given <hi>any ſuch Marks</hi> by which men may know <hi>Reprobation,</hi> that ſo he might retard no mans endeavours after grace. Indeed, there be marks of <hi>Election,</hi> by which we may make that <hi>ſure</hi> to our ſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. but the <hi>want of theſe</hi> doth not diſcover <hi>Reprobation,</hi> becauſe theſe are all wanting in the deareſt Saints of God till they be truly converted; and ſo, if that conſequence were ſound, <hi>Such true Graces diſcover Election, therefore the want of them diſcovers Reprobation,</hi> it would follow, that Gods Saints before they are converted, (ſeeing they want thoſe graces) are either not elected, and ſo Election would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Calling, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and Election would not be from eternity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

The Word ſpeaks plainly in this caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. <hi>Secret things belong unto God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Thou haſt abundant grounds to believe the contrary, <hi>viz. That thou art Elected,</hi> if thine eyes were open to ſee them.

In ſtead therefore of ſearching the Decrees of God, whether thou be elected or no, ſearch into thy own heart, and ſee whether thou canſt find that thou art called, and ſo in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſanctified; the diſcovery of grace in thy heart, though but one <hi>grain,</hi> and that of <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed;</hi> will aſſure thee of thy Election, and final ſalvation. Canſt thou not find in thy heart any ſorrow for ſin, any earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after holineſſe, any ſolicitouſneſſe to pleaſe God, any tenderneſs of conſcience and fearfulneſs to offend him, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> If thou canſt, think theſe be flowers that uſe not to grow in Natures garden.

               <p>IN the next place how effectually ſhould this ſtirre up all of us that are <hi>converted by way of a Spirit of Bondage,</hi> to labour after a Spirit of Adoption, in its witneſſing act.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſee that the Spirit of Adoption is <hi>attainable,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially by you</hi> of all other men. You are under the qualification of thoſe to whom he doth eſpecially belong. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. <hi>To you is the word of this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſent.</hi> Chriſt was <hi>annointed with the Oyl of gladneſſe</hi> for your ſakes.</p>
               <p>Are not your <hi>hearts broken,</hi> are not you <hi>mourners in Sion,</hi> are not you the ſubjects of a <hi>ſpirit of heavineſſe,</hi> a <hi>wrinkled,</hi> a <hi>contracted ſpirit,</hi> as the Word ſignifies, a Spirit even grown old and wrinkled with grief? Here then is a word of encouragement for you, let it not fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>What ſtriving is there for places when they fall in the Univerſities under ſuch and ſuch qualifications, how doth every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the qualifications beſtirre himſelf for his intereſt? And will you (being in ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity)
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170084:134"/> loſe the priviledge of that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Spirit of Adoption in its aſſuring act is a <hi>precious mercy.</hi> Friends, do you count it a great matter to be aſſured of ſuch a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> inheritance? Will you think it worth your time to ſearch Deeds, and Records, and Offices to confirm a title to your ſelves and your heirs; and is it worth no pains to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your immortal ſouls of an <hi>eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance?</hi> When a Merchant adventures a ſhip to the ſea, if he adventure much in the Veſſel, how doth he hye him to the <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Office,</hi> that if he can he may be no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer by his Adventure, what ever chance befal him? O Friends, you are every day lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into the Ocean of eternity, your Fraught is your precious ſouls, that are more worth then all the world. The Spirit keeps an <hi>Aſſurance Office,</hi> hye you to the Spirit, and never leave till you have aſſured your preſent Adventure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am aſſured of this; Without the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit, that you are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, no ſoul here deliberately dares to dye. Poſſibly a <hi>Roman Valour</hi> may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men on upon deſperate dangers, when the temptations of honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are preſent, to put out of their minds the thoughts of an adventured eternity with the hopes of the preſent life. Thoſe Parents that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> could not have endured the cryes of their dear little
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170084:134"/> ones, roaſted alive in the Arms of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Idol, had not the Drummes and other loud Inſtruments drowned the noiſe. And truly no man can deliberately ſacrifice his ſoul to Satan, or adventure his ſoul neer the borders of hell, whiles his ears are open to the fearful yellings &amp; ſcriechings of damned ſpirits; and therefore Satan makes a terrible din in their eares, jingles the fine things of this world, and makes ſuch a noiſe with them, that he leads them firſt into a fools Paradiſe, and from thence into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Friends, Did ſuch thoughts as theſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe any of you now and then, <hi>Here I crawle up and down in the world, a poor worm of two or three cubits long, and after a few minutes more be ſpent (it may be this night) this hour the foot of death may tread me into the earth; I carry a Jewel in this earthly Cabinet, that is more worth then all the world. If Satan lay hands on it, I am infinitely miſerable to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and whether (if I dye this night) the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels may not come to fetch away my ſoul I know not. O if I could dye into another world once, and have hopes to live again and recover my condition, if it proved worſe then my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might adventure one of thoſe lives upon an uncertainty; but when as I muſt dye into eternity, that my Sun muſt ſet and never riſe again; that what is ſaid of a war is more true of death; that in it,</hi> non licet bis errare; <hi>that (though the tree that is cut down through the</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:170084:135"/> 
                  <hi>ſent of water, may grow again, yet) when a man dyes, he cannot live again in this world,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 14, 9, 10. 14</note> 
                  <hi>but muſt meaſure out either wo or happineſſe by the minutes of eternity. O what is it worth to have the Spirit of God teſtifie, that we are his children, new born to the Inheritance of the Saints in light?</hi> O how precious a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is it to have the zeal and earneſt of that Spirit to aſſure it beyond Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am aſſured of this alſo, that without the witneſſe of the Spirit you cannot ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have your <hi>hearts untyed</hi> from wordly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances. It is true indeed, that a ſoul that hears of the <hi>excellency of Chriſt,</hi> and the glory of thoſe things that are <hi>within the Vail,</hi> may be convinced by the Spirit of God, to <hi>adventure</hi> all that he hath for them; but 'tis ſtill with fear, leſt he ſhould miſcarry in the loſſe of both. As a <hi>Merchant</hi> that is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured that there is Merchandiſe in the <hi>Indies</hi> that is more precious then thoſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Commodities that he adventures for it, may be drawn to put his whole eſtate in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, that he may make a voyage thither: but ſtill there are miſgiving and diſtracting cares attend this adventure. <hi>O</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have put all I have into ſuch a bottom, indeed if it return ſafe, I may be a hundredfold gainer; but ſea and Pirates may rob me of all my hopes, and then I am loſt both in my preſent eſtate, and future expectations.</hi> So a man to whom the Goſpel is preached, upon the preſenting
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170084:135"/> Chriſt as infinitely precious to the ſoul, may be brought to deny himſelf, and forſake all to follow Chriſt, out of hopes to enjoy him, but 'tis with much fear. <hi>True</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I get Chriſt, I am an infinite gainer. But if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cheat me, or if Chriſt will not entertain me, then I am of all men moſt miſerable, I have loſt all my comforts, my portion of this life, and eternity too.</hi> And therefore till the ſoul be ſure of Chriſt, it ever caſts an eye backward as <hi>Lots</hi> wife on <hi>Sodom;</hi> though Grace check thoſe fears, and keeps the ſoul on in its courſe yet ſtill I ſay, it meets with many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to think upon its adventure (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if Chriſt frown a while) and to wiſh that it were to do again, and many ſad ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis an hard thing for a poor ſoul to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all the world, and have nothing in hand for it, but only to expect its returnes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. What ſayes the worldling? <hi>A bird in the hand is worth two in the buſh;</hi> and that Cardinal, <hi>Give me my part in</hi> Paris, <hi>and take who will my part in Paradiſe?</hi> And as ſome ſay now, as well as in the Apoſtles time, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye,</hi>

                  <hi>and after death we know not where we ſhall fare better.</hi> But a man that gets the witneſſe of the Spirit, is like one that adventures for a preſent Commodity, a Commodity in hand, a thouſand times beyond his price; or hath the earneſt of his bargain put into his hand, &amp; is certainly aſſured of the faithful delivery of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170084:136"/> the whole at an appointed time. He never looks back upon his bargain ſo as to be tempted to <hi>repent</hi> it, but rather as <hi>rejoycing</hi> that for ſo little he hath gotten ſo much.

                  <hi>But Chriſt hath dyed for all men, and ſo I have a ſhare in his bloud.</hi> O deſperate Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!

                  <hi>But I have gifts more then ordinary. I can pray and expound Scripture, and convert and build up others.</hi> And yet thou maiſt be like <hi>ſounding braſs or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.</p>

               <p>One reſolutely chears up his heart, and (as it were) <hi>enforceth</hi> himſelfe to take comfort, and to be at peace in the aſſurance of his good condition) without follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in Duties and Ordinances for it.</p>
               <p>Another begins to <hi>idolize</hi> his Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now ſure (ſaith he) my eſtate is good, for I hear attentively, pray affectionately, ſhed tears over my ſins abundantly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reaſons himſelf into this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170084:137"/> fetching from the Word ſuch and ſuch grounds which he perſwades himſelf ſuites his condition, and thence concludes all wel. And you ſhall ſee hereafter how fallible theſe are.</p>
               <p>3 The longer you go without the Spirits teſtimony, the more <hi>difficultly</hi> will you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it: the more will your hearts be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in <hi>Satans Sophiſtry</hi> to elude Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of comfort (if you be ſuch as look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God;) the more experience wil you have of your own <hi>hearts deceitfulneſſe;</hi> ſo-that you will deal with them as we ordinarily do with common lyars, hardly be perſwaded to believe their Teſtimony, when they ſpeak the truth concerning you.</p>
               <p>If you be ſuch as neglect both grace and aſſurance, know that the more difficultly will you bring your ſelves to accept of grace, the longer you delay it; the heart will be <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the deceitfulneſſe of ſin, Heb.</hi> 3. 13. The Spirit grived, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if you get grace, a thouſand to one if you get the <hi>witneſſe of the Spirit</hi> to teſtifie that you have it. Though God give ſuch men grace as put it off to the laſt, yet it were too great an encouragement to others to delay in like manner, if he ſhould ordinarily let them know it. 'Tis no eaſie matter at any time to get it, much more difficult when delayed: Many ſouls for many years together <hi>eat no pleaſant bread,</hi> and when they drink <hi>mingle their drink with weeping,</hi> their <hi>ſleep departeth from them,</hi> and all the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170084:137"/> of their lives are overcaſt with a ſad cloud of darkneſs, they go from <hi>ſea to ſea,</hi> to wait on the Ordinances, riſe many a night to pray when others ſleep, <hi>chaſten their ſouls with faſting, and go heavily all the day long;</hi> and this, (as I ſaid) for divers years together, and this in the flower of their years and ſtrength and yet with much ado can get little more then ſome flaſhes of comfort now and then, ſome <hi>gleams</hi> of light (as I told you before) to ſave them at a deſperate pinch; and after long exerciſe in a doubtful <hi>medly</hi> of hope and fear, a ſad <hi>twilight</hi> of ſorrowes and ſupports, at laſt recover this teſtimony in and to their hearts, that they are the children of God. And therefore 'tis not to be thought, that perſons who out of wilfulneſſe or ſpiritual ſloath put off the procuring this bleſſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to themſelves till old age or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of death, ſhould ſuddenly leap out of a certain damnable eſtate, into an aſſured certainty of ſalvation. Sure the ſtream of Promiſes in the Word is leaſt favourable to ſuch perſons, and it is a thing moſt righteous in the eyes of reaſon it ſelf, that God ſhould be as ſlow in <hi>giving,</hi> as they are in <hi>ſeeking</hi> this aſſuring teſtimony.</p>

                  <label>Queſt.</label> BUt how ſhall I get the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be aſſured of my Juſtification and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. There are divers Hindrances to be temoved, and then divers Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be followed. Hinderances are</p>
               <p>1 A ſecret <hi>murmuring</hi> frame of ſpirit againſt Gods preſent diſpenſations towards thee; as if God dealt very hardly, and contrary to his wonted courſe with thee. As if God had ſet thee up as the only mark of his diſpleaſure; which diſcontent is ſecretly augmented by the enjoyments and attainments of others. Such and ſuch have attained ſuch and ſuch comforts, and walk cheerfully, but God keeps me in the <hi>dark, like them that art dead long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> And then, (as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs) the ſoul many times quarrels at God for doing what he hath done, and wiſhes any change, even to what it was, or the worſt that can be, <hi>Would God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we had dyed in Egypt; nay, would God we were out of the world, any way rather then to be thus</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:170084:138"/> 
                  <hi>toſſed up and down in theſe tempeſts of ſpirit, to be made Satans Tennis-bals, the gazing ſtocks of the world, and a terrour to our ſelves, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friend, who ever thou art, that art in this frame of ſpirit; know, the Holy Spirit wil not be wrought to ſmile on thy heart by theſe means. Such a dogged, ſullen frame of ſpirit will but procure thee the more laſhes, and continue thee the longer in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Iſraels</hi> murmurings kept them <hi>forty years</hi> in the wilderneſſe: hereby they vexed Gods holy Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 10 and ſo doſt thou, and thou maiſt expect a proportionable deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Gods hands.</p>
               <p>2 A kind of <hi>delight in complaining</hi> againſt thy ſelf, and taking Satans part many times in bearing falſe witneſs againſt thy own ſoul. Sometimes a kind of <hi>ſinful humility,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an <hi>apprehenſion of eaſe,</hi> in venting the cauſes of their trouble, and ſometimes a <hi>deſigne of provoking others to humor</hi> them in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thoſe corraſives and terrors to them which they think are their portion; makes many perſons liberal in charging themſelves in this ſort. And ſomtimes (Satan helping them) they are apt to lay more load upon themſelves then indeed belongs to them, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating their ſins beyond meaſure, and condemning themſelves for the vileſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the face of the earth. And (by conſtant uſe) I know not what kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, grows out of ſuch libelling themſelves,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170084:139"/> and they are never ſo well, as when they are in that tune. I grant, a ſerious, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and diſcreet complaining of our ſins, and wants, to ſuch from whoſe advice and prayers we may expect good, and for this reaſon, that we may get their advice, and prayers, they knowing our condition parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and being thereby enabled to help us, by ſuch a through knowledge of our caſe; is not onely lawfull, and expedient, but neceſſary. But to be always, <hi>in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> urging theſe indictments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ones ſelfe, and meerly for this reaſon, that we may put from our ſelves thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truths which are indeavoured to be faſtened upon us, doth but more indiſpoſe us to peace and ſatisfaction of ſpirit, and teach Satan an art of troubling us everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with our own liking and approbation. Take this for a certain rule. That ſoul that will not open to the Spirit of Adoption, till he can find no matter of complaint againſt himſelfe, may go mourning all his days, and thank himſelf for it.</p>
               <p>3. An <hi>unthankful denyal</hi> of the works of Gods ſanctifying ſpirit in the heart. Which are the material ground of all regular aſſurance from the Spirit of Adoption; or (at leaſt) mitigating, qualifying, and extenuating them. This ordinarily accompanies the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. A ſoul that delights it ſelf in picking quarrels againſt its own peace, will not bee eaſily brought to own any good concerning
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170084:139"/> it ſelf. Tell a man in this frame, Sir, you are one of Gods called ones, for <hi>you have had experience of a gracious change upon your heart. You now hate ſin, &amp; count it your greateſt burthen, which once you loved and judged it your greateſt comfort; you have an unſatisfiable longing after Chriſt, not only in his merits, but in his graces, and the communication of his holineſſe, and all the World will not ſatisfy you without him; you have an heart perfectly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from all your old company, and all your delight is in the Saints that are upon earth, and them that excell in vertue: you have a tender heart, that is deeply affected with every known ſinne, &amp;c. O ſir,</hi> (will ſuch a perſon often-times ſay) <hi>I find no ſuch things in me, and if there were, I fear it is all in hypocriſie.</hi> Friend, you do well in fearing hypocriſie: but you do not well in not owning what God hath wrought in you for fear of hypocriſie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not good to <hi>boaſt</hi> of the good that is in us, when wee have temptations from the approbation of others, to glory in it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it good to <hi>deny</hi> what is in us when we have a call thereunto by thoſe who are ſent by God to examine our eſtate; which they can never do, nor can they know how to deal with us, if we deal not plainly in confeſſing what we know and find in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And it falls out too often that ſuch deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls (as I ſaid before) are the fruit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, which oftentimes cauſeth us to overlook, and (in a kind of compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way) to deny what we have received,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170084:140"/> becauſe we have not as much as we would have. As it falls out in the covetous men of the world (and there is a ſinful ſpiritual covetouſneſſe too) that are ever complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have <hi>no money, no bread to put in their mouths,</hi> &amp;c. whereas indeed they mean, they have not ſo much as they would have. This is an unthankful denyal of Gods providence towards them, in beſtowing on them what they have. And thou maiſt judg the like of thy ſelf in this caſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he makes many ſad complaints of himſelf, <hi>I am carnal ſold under ſin; in me there dwelleth no good thing; how to perform that that is good I find not; when I would do good, evil is preſent with me; I ſee a Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> yet ſtill he mixeth acknowledgments of the grace that he hath received, <hi>I am carnal</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſold under ſin; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I bleſſe God my judgment goes with the Law, I think it holy juſt and good;</hi> whence though I am over-byaſſed many times unto evil, yet <hi>I allow it not;</hi> I would do better then I do, and I <hi>hate the evil that I am captived unto. In me there dwelleth no good thing;</hi> but mark the Epanorthoſis, or correction of himſelf, as if he had ſpoken a word too large; What ſaid I? there is no good dwelling in me? let me not be miſtaken, I mean, in my <hi>fleſh,</hi> (for ſo much the <gap reason="foreign">

I do not the good that I ought to do, yet I <hi>would do it, I delight in the Law of God in the inward man.</hi> Sin lawes it, and lords it in my members, but <hi>I have another Law in my mind, ſo that with my mind,</hi> i. e. in my judgment, and reſolved bent of will, <hi>I ſerve the Law of God;</hi> and there is a ſpecial Emphaſis in that Pronoune, <hi>[my ſelf,]</hi> that followes, <hi>ver</hi> 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I [my ſelfe] ſerve the Law of God,</hi> that is, <hi>even I,</hi> though I complain ſo againſt my ſelf, yet muſt needs ſay ſo much for my ſelf, to the praiſe of God, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is an excellent example for thee that ſitteſt in darkneſſe, and art ever complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt and defying thy ſelf; do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the grace of God, that is not ſo much a denyal of thy ſelf, as Gods goodneſſe, and the Spirit of Grace. If thou witneſſe <hi>againſt</hi> the Spirit, doſt thou think the Spirit will witneſſe for thee? Thou denyeſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the very <hi>medium</hi> by which he would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to thy good condition.</p>
               <p>Take notice alſo of the peeviſhneſſe of thy ſpirit. Thou haſt long wooed Chriſt to accept of thee, and be married to thee, and Chriſt hath ſent thee Love-tokens by his Spirit to aſſure thee that he owns himſelf to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170084:141"/> be thy busband. Now Chriſt expects the duties of a wife from thee, now thou que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioneſt whether thou art married or no, and not only queſtioneſt, but peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeſt all his Love-tokens, or at leaſt extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateſt them and ſetteſt light by them. Think what a ſin this is. No wonder now if the Spirit, that Meſſenger that brought them, take offence at ſuch dealing, and refuſe to teſtifie to thee, who art reſolved to queſtion his teſtimony, bee it never ſo cleare.</p>
               <p>4. An unwarrantable <hi>thruſting off</hi> thoſe Promiſes and comfortable truths which God in the Miniſtry of the Word or otherwiſe brings home to our condition, and <hi>ſnatching</hi> greedily at all the terrible places of Scripture and denunciations of wrath as our portion. I have knowne thoſe that have thruſt away with both hands all that might make for their comfort, as that that belongs not to them. O the curſed pride of our hearts! When will men leave preſcribing to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſe God? When people pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their ſins, then they will hear no Miniſter except he ſing a curſed <hi>requiem</hi> to their ſpirits, preach pleaſing things, and cry, <hi>Peace, peace.</hi> And when the ſoul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trouble for ſin, then God muſt denounce judgments in every Sermon, ſpeak to them in <hi>thunders and lightning</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai, anſwer them cut of the whirlewind,</hi> or elſe they will not hear him. Believe it, no ſoul
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170084:141"/> receiveth good by the Word, but that ſoul that thinks every Word of the Lord good; and labours, as it is proper to its condition, to apply it. Satan in times of <hi>unregeneracy</hi> hath an Art to make the Word unfruitful, by cauſing a mans heart to ſtand looſe from the <hi>Law,</hi> to rub off the eating, corroding plaiſter, and ſay, <hi>This concernes ſuch an one, and ſuch an one, but not me.</hi> And after our <hi>converſion,</hi> he keeps the Word from faſtning comfort to the ſoul, and aſſuring the heart by a like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. <hi>True, theſe are comfortable truths, and concern ſuch and ſuch, but not me.</hi> This was the Pſalmiſts caſe in deſertion, and is thine in the preſent darkneſſe: <hi>My ſore ran in the night, my ſoul refuſed to be comforted,</hi> Pſal. 77. 2.</p>
               <p>Indeed friends, if you refuſe to receive comfort when the Spirit offers it, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if when you would have it, the Spirit refuſe to offer it. None of Gods offers are refuſed by the creature <hi>gratis.</hi> God will ſtand upon other termes when we come to his ſhop after wee have once refuſed a good bargain once offered.</p>
               <p>5 A groundleſſe <hi>ſurmiſing</hi> of an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verableneſſe in our condition from ſuch and ſuch <hi>threatnings of Scripture</hi> as concerne us not. This followes from the former; When a ſoul is willing to hear all <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot</hi> from the Word, ordinarily the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel hath two or three places of Scripture from whence he playes <hi>thick</hi> upon the ſoul.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170084:142"/> Thoſe are two places in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. and 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. And one in the ſecond of <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 20, 21. In the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome dark phraſes in thoſe Texts of Scripture, doth Satan perplex the ſoul, and this is a ſtrong hold that he will not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurrender. Thus he perſwades them, that every neglect of duty, every vain thought or wicked action after illumination, and the work of conviction, utterly, and totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth them from repentance or pardon; and therefore it is in vain to endeavour their comfort, who have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt that ſhould comfort them, and that unpardonably, and irrecoverably.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken to this already in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, and ſhall again hereafter. And therfore it ſhall ſuffice at preſent to warn you of this rub which Satan laies in the way of your peace, and to intreat you to take no heed to it, when it is obtruded to barre you from laying hold of the promiſes of mercy and pardon, which are proclaimed unto you. For take this for a certain rule, <hi>God never intends any terrours of Scripture, as bugbears to affright any ſinner from Chriſt who earneſtly deſires him,</hi> (the ſevereſt ſcorpions of the Law are intended only to drive us <hi>to Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3. 24.) <hi>much leſſe doth he intend that any of them ſhould conclude any ſoul under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended impoſſibility of pardon; for then he would be chargeable with all thoſe deſperate concluſions which men uſually draw from ſuch</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:170084:142"/> 
                  <hi>premiſes. But he always encourageth the greateſt ſinners to beleeve, and</hi> (ſuppoſing that) <hi>to take comfort from the boundleſneſſe of his mercy in pardoning all maner of ſinnes. Iſay</hi> 55. 7. and 1. 18.</p>
               <p>How frequently doth he (for their ſakes) diſplay his bowels of tender mercies, as if he foreſaw that the greateſt difficulty of his work would lie in perſwading them of thoſe?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Certain other Hinderances remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</head>
               <p>A Sixth Hinderance is, 6. <hi>Keeping Satans counſel.</hi> Many a ſoul bears ſad burthens in this kind often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, becauſe he is aſhamed to utter what it is that troubles him. As many a man bears a Diſeaſe in ſome part, which he is loath to diſcover, and will not be knowne of it till there be no remedy but he muſt dye of it. This is Satans policy, to repreſent the ſoul before converſion as beautiful in all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of civility and good nature (as we ſay) and formality as is poſſible. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter converſion, when the ſoul pants after
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170084:143"/> Aſſurance of Gods love, then to ſhew it its own face in as black a glaſſe, as hell, or (its Landskip) an accuſing, terrifying conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can afford. And therefore he enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ordinary infirmities into monſtrous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacies, and ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and if the ſoul be ſatisfied that its ſins are not of that dye, becauſe it never entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thought of malice and envy againſt God or his wayes, (which is required to that ſin) Then he will inject fearful ſuggeſtions into the mind, <hi>horribilia de Deo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>horrid thoughts of God, Chriſt, Religion, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c.</hi> And then he acts as a wicked Whore; when he hath laid theſe brats of his at a Saints door, then he purſues him as the father of them for maintenance, ſolicites Reaſon to defend them, or at leaſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute them; and if a ſoul throw them out as faſt as he caſts them in, then he makes it his next buſineſſe to perſwade it to keep his counſel in theſe thoughts and temptations; for (ſaith he) what will godly people think of thee, if thou ſhouldſt diſcover ſuch things as theſe? No one that fears God would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come nigh thee any more.</p>
               <p>So concerning thoughts of <hi>ſelf-murder, temptations to fearful and horrid pollutions, &amp;c.</hi> If he cannot faſten them upon the heart, he will labour (at leaſt) to prevail for our ſecrecy in them. And then he knowes he can make great advantages of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments. As a looſe companion when he
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170084:143"/> hath tempted an honeſt woman to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cannot prevail, his next deſigne is to perſwade her to keep his attempt cloſe, and to allow him her company ſtill; which if he can do, he will afterwards (as being one that regards not his owne reputation) blaſt her, as if ſhe were really guilty of the Fact, and endeavor to make her concealment of his temptations, and continued converſe with him, the Argument to prove her ſo: So if Satan can prevail ſo far, he will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade a ſoul that he hath conſented to what he hath concealed, and ſo lay all that load of deſperate concluſions which would follow from the ſins themſelves upon the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of them. And therefore as a woman that is honeſt and wiſe, will diſcover ſuch ſollicitations to an husband or near friend, and deſire them to watch over her, leſt ſhe be overcome by importunity to an act ſhe ſo much abhors, and if need be, will reveal them more publickly, by way of Caution, for her fuller Vindication: So in this caſe it is the beſt way to deal with Satan. Let no ſuch thought ariſe, but away firſt to God, and then to a godly Miniſter, or a godly friend, and unboſom thy ſelfe, for hereby thou ſhalt be able to call witneſſe againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan upon every occaſion, and take away the advantage from him of ſuggeſting many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate thoughts to thee, which if he have ſo much footing as thy bare ſilence, he will inject with a great deal of vehemency. On
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170084:144"/> the other ſide, he will quickly be diſcouraged from tempting, if what he ſpeaks in ſecret, were publiſhed upon the <hi>houſe tops.</hi>

               <p>7 Secret <hi>tempting of God,</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> upon ſuch means and ſuch men for <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>limiting God</hi> to ſuch and ſuch a time, and <hi>reſolving</hi> not to wait on God beyond that time, or not to expect it from any other meanes. It may bee ſlighted means and an unexpected time ſhall bring thee that comfort which thou haſt in vain looked for from more <hi>likely</hi> inſtruments, and more <hi>probable</hi> ſeaſons. Truly friends, God will have <hi>peace</hi> as well as <hi>grace</hi> to be every way <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>unconfined.</hi> Say not, <hi>ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter indeed is an honeſt man, and preacheth well, but I ſhall never profit by him; if ever I have comfort it muſt be from ſuch or ſuch a mouth.</hi> Say not, if <hi>God anſwer me not in ſuch an ordinance, or ſuch a duty, I am hopeleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> It oftentimes falls out here as it doth in dangerous diſeaſes among great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; They perſwade themſelves that ſuch or ſuch a <hi>plain, honeſt Phyſician,</hi> whom they vouchſafe to conſult with in ordinary caſes, is able to do them no good in their preſent diſtempers; he is not ſtudied, or hath not experience enough, and therefore they muſt adviſe with ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Court Doctor</hi> of eminent practiſe, and then they think they cannot miſſe of a cure.</p>
               <p>But many times it ſo happens, that after they have ſpent their ſtrength and eſtate on
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170084:144"/> fees and bills, and are come down into the Country to dye, a plain <hi>countrey Phyſician,</hi> and a little <hi>Kitchin-phyſick</hi> hath reſtored them. Truly friends, 'tis ſo in the caſe of aſſurance from the Spirit, Becauſe <hi>ſome</hi> godly Miniſters cannot preach ſo every way experimentally as <hi>others</hi> can, many troubled ſpirits decline them, and their miniſtery, and will ſcarce vouchſafe to diſcover their caſes to them. None muſt be ſuppoſed able to do them good, but ſuch, and ſuch: Well, ſuch mens miniſtery is tryed, and it may be (not out of any deficiency in them, who it is poſſible may preach truths, and apply medicines of ſoveraign value and vertue; but meerely) through a ſecret hand of God rendering them unſucceſſefull, that he may keep the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of his Eembaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from contempt, and the moſt <hi>eminent</hi> humble, and let people know, that the Spirit of conſolation and Adoption, as well as that of <hi>grace and ſupplication, bloweth where, and whence, and when,</hi> and <hi>how he liſteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the ſoul-patient finds no recovery, but it is fain at laſt to bee beholden to a man of very mean abilities, and to a word which ſeemed emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and barren before, for comfort and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>So, for <hi>time.</hi> A ſoul enlarged in prayer, ſteeped in tears, enflamed with deſires, thinks, now verily <hi>the time, the ſet time is come,</hi> God will be found of me in a way of peace, and ſatisfaction. No friend, no
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170084:145"/> ſuch matter. God (it may be) will make thee ſtay till thou haſt even doubted thy ſelf out of all hope, becauſe of thy barreneſſe, and deadneſſe, and inability to perform any ſervice as thou oughteſt, and then he will ſend his Spirit to ſhed abroad his love in thy heart: thou ſhalt bring ſorth this child of comfort, when, as <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, thy ſoul is dead, and almoſt hopeleſſely barren.</p>
               <p>8. A ſinfull <hi>ambition of ſelf-preparations</hi> for comfort and peace: were I ſo much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſaith the poor ſoul, ſo kindly and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly affected with my ſins; could I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of this deadneſſe, and flatneſſe of ſpirit into any meaſure of livelineſſe and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my performances; then I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve comfort, and aſſurance of Gods love belonged to me; but that a ſoul ſo little, ſo legally broken as I am, ſo barren, ſapleſſe, lifeleſſe, ſpiritleſſe in all my ſervices ſhould have any ſhare in Chriſt, any title to the Covenant of Grace, any part or portion with the Saints of God, I cannot, I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. This is juſt like <hi>Peters</hi> unreaſonable motion: <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man, O Lord. Luke,</hi> 5. 8. Fooliſh man, to whom ſhould the <hi>Phyſician</hi> come but to the <hi>ſick?</hi> 'Twere a fond thing to imagine the patient muſt be recovered, before he comes that he may be ſit to entertain him. So here; Thou wilt not entertain any perſwaſion of an intereſt in Chriſt, till thou attain ſuch and ſuch proportions and meaſures of grace.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170084:145"/> Alas! man, till thou have ſome evidence of thy intereſt in Chriſt, thou wilt never a tain them: 'tis want of that evidence occaſions thy defects in humiliation, thy deadneſſe and ſappleſſeneſſe in duties, &amp;c. Men travel heartleſſely in the <hi>darke,</hi> becauſe they know not whether they go backwards or forwards, whether the next ſtep may not be a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice to ruine them. But when the <hi>day-light</hi> ariſeth, and ſhews them by the coaſt of the country, that they are in their way, this puts new life and ſpirits into them. <hi>The joy of the Lord is</hi> a Chriſtians <hi>ſtrength. Neh.</hi> 8. 10. Nor is it meet, whiles thou art in this frame, that thou ſhouldſt have this witneſſe in thy Spirit, For if thou ſhouldſt recover more life and vigour of grace and duty, and thy aſſurance therein, thou perhaps wouldſt be proud of thy attainments, and attribute thy aſſurance to them, and ſo God would have leſſe honour and thou leſſe certainty of it. God would have leſſe honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I ſaid) grace I would ſcarce be ſeen through ſuch qualifications.

               <p>And thou wouldſt have leſſe certainty of continuing it. For it would riſe and fall according to thy own qualifications and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. For water in a water-courſe will never
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170084:146"/> riſe above its ſpring; if the ſpring of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be your own perfections, then as that is higher and lower, ſo will the aſſurance be. You that one time find your graces at a ſpring tide, another time will find them at the loweſt ebbe, and then your aſſurance will ebbe with them, as it flowes with them.</p>
               <p>9.

But if thou deſire to know the leaſt meaſure of grace meerly for this reaſon, that thou maiſt not (like an unskilful Gardiner) <hi>weed</hi> it up when it is tender, for a <hi>weed of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> but cheriſh it, and water it, and improve it to greater meaſures of perfection, this is a good deſign.</p>

As in a <hi>caſe of Law</hi> among men is clear; A man hath a Title to ſuch Lands, as by the advice of Lawyers, and from Law he conceiveth to be good, or (at leaſt) after many debates with an adverſary that obſtructs his quiet poſſeſſion, he ſees not by any thing that can be urged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that his own is the moſt likely Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. If this man enter upon this Eſtate, and uſe it as his own, till the Advarſary produce a more legal evidence then his, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it in Court, the man offends not.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>conſcience.</hi> Gods <hi>Miniſters</hi> that are
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170084:151"/> the <hi>Counſellours</hi> in its caſes, tell thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their beſt knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that thou art a child of God, and haſt an unqueſtionable Title to him; this they prove by Scripture, compared with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Gods ſanctifying Spirit in thy heart. Satan ſayes no, and thy own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving heart fears leſt he ſay true. However thou ſeeſt no reaſon he brings from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or at leaſt none ſo weighty as that thou ſeeſt ſufficient cauſe from his allegations to reject thoſe other that make for thee; nay, it may be thy judgment inclines to them, but thy heart is yet fearful and trembling: in ſuch a caſe thou maiſt ſafely practiſe, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerves, upon that concluſion which thou ſeeſt leaſt to weaken. I mean, thou maiſt act as a child of God, apply Promiſes, urge them in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they were thine, till ſome more conſiderable grounds be offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to weaken the former upon which thou actedſt. This I ſay, becauſe I know it is the doubt of ſome precious ſouls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may pray or apply any Promiſes, til they be altogether out of doubt that they are the children of God.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Nay let me ſay more. If thou have but the <hi>leaſt ground</hi> to <hi>hope,</hi> that though thou be not a child of God for the preſent, yet thou art no where excluded from a capacity of being ſo; thou maiſt lay hold upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which belong to Saints, ſo far as to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to duty,</hi> though thou maiſt not ſo
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170084:151"/> far as to <hi>build an Aſſurance</hi> upon them. And the reaſon is, becauſe the Goſpel <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mine</hi> by my <hi>laying hold upon it,</hi> and <hi>claiming it as mine.</hi> And God allowes a Chriſtian an <hi>holy violence</hi> in entering upon the precious poſſeſſions thereof; <hi>the violent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 12</note> 
                  <hi>take it by force.</hi> If a man ſhould never lay hold of a Promiſe till he be aſſured that it belongs to him, he would never lay hold of any: becauſe (as I ſhall tell you more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) Aſſurance that the Promiſes and the things promiſed in them are mine, depends upon my laying hold of them, and claiming them as mine, and therefore cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in an orderly and ordinary way.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes when mine own ſcrupulous heart will take no ſatisfaction, I ought to lay ſome weight of confidence upon the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others,</hi> godly Miniſters, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtian friends. <hi>A ſtander by</hi> (ſay we) <hi>oftentimes ſees more then the parties in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can ſee themſelves.</hi> I believe my <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> concerning the ſtate of my <hi>body,</hi> and my <hi>Lawyer</hi> concerning the ſtate of my <hi>Sute,</hi> though (it may be) I have ſtrong inclinations of my ſelf to make a contrary judgment; and upon their judgment, I follow the ones <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and the others <hi>counſel.</hi> 'Tis not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſmall moment, when upon the ſight of thy ſerious humiliation and ſorrow for ſin, earneſt and reſtleſſe deſires after Chriſt and holineſs, and the like ſignes a Miniſter of Chriſt in his name ſhall declare, that (as far
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170084:152"/> as the Word gives him ground to judge of thy caſe) he fully perſwades himſelfe that thou art a child of God. The Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>confirme the Word of his Servants, and perform the counſel of his Meſſengers,</hi> Iſai. 44. 26. And it is not for nothing that he hath promiſed to <hi>looſe in heaven what they looſe on earth,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. 'Tis true, they may <hi>err</hi> in the <hi>Application;</hi> and God is not bound to juſtifie them in their <hi>miſtakes.</hi> But yet it is as true, that ſeldom doth a godly knowing Miniſter (and ſuch an one only is fit to bee conſulted in ſuch caſes) ſo groſly miſtake the caſe of his Soul-Patient, as to miſ-apply comforts, but upon ſuch grounds as wil hold water according to the Word; and he cannot be ſo much an enemy to thy ſoul and his own, as to go about wilfully to deceive thee.</p>
               <p>So may it be ſaid of the judgment of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and experienced Chriſtians,</hi> that although they cannot abſolve the troubled ſoul <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively</hi> (as Miniſters can) and charge you to reſt in their word in the name of Chriſt; yet they may paſſe a <hi>private ſentence</hi> upon your condition from the Word, and their own experience; and you are bound not to reject it raſhly and inconſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The leaſt that you can allow to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſuch perſons of both ſorts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your eſtate is, (1.) A <hi>charitable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of it, and the grounds upon which
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170084:152"/> they give it; ſo far as to think thus of it; Why may not I (in darkneſs and confuſion of ſpirit) be rather deceived in my judgment of my ſelf, then ſuch perſons, who (as they are free from my diſtempers, and entirely love my ſoul, ſo) have more intimate acquaintance with God, and the light of their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to keep them from miſtaking? (2) <hi>Hearty prayer</hi> to God, that he will make good the words of his ſervants, and open your heart to receive them.

               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> But how can I <hi>rely upon</hi> that grace which I am not <hi>aſſured</hi> belongs unto me? If I rely upon a friend in a matter of moment concerning whom I have no certain evidence that he ever intended mee any good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may deceive my ſelf, and thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do my ſelfe, while I leane to a <hi>broken reed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:170084:153"/>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. The <hi>being aſſured</hi> that God is mine in particular, is not the only ground of my relyance upon him. 'Tis true, there be acts of <hi>relyance</hi> that follow <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> when a man relies upon God as a, <hi>knowne friend.</hi> But yet there are acts of Reliance that precede Aſſurance, as when I rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as one that hath offered to be a friend to all that will duly make uſe of him. Such a friend I am not aſſured is my friend in particular, before I go to him; but I go to him, take hold of his offer, claim his Promiſe, and reſolve to adventure my ſelfe thereupon, and thus at laſt I get a good word from him that gives me a particular aſſurance that it ſhall be <hi>with me according to my faith,</hi> Mat. 9. 29.</p>
               <p>That you may underſtand this the more clearly, know, there be theſe <hi>four acts</hi> in faith, and they are like ſo many <hi>ſtaires</hi> one above the other, the one being the ground of the other. I deny not but they may all be brought together in time. But in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (I apprehend from the Word) they are produced in this order: Thoſe are</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Acceptance.</hi> The Goſpel reveals life and ſalvation to poor undone ſinners through Chriſt, who abandoning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their own ſins and righteouſneſs, are contented to receive it from him in his own way. The <hi>anſwer of the heart</hi> to this Truth is, <hi>It is a ſaying worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. And (accordingly) I
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170084:154"/> accept of theſe termes and reſolve in Gods ſtrength, I will not ſeek ſalvation in <hi>any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name. Lord Chriſt accept of me, I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render my ſelf into thy hands, I beſeech thee diſcharge all thy Offices on, and for me.</hi> This is called <hi>receiving, John</hi> 1. 12. It is ſometimes expreſſed by a term of motion, <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> John 6. 37. yea, <hi>flying for refuge to him,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. Both which imply, renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of other ſecurity, and accepting his alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Claim.</hi> The next thing apprehended in the Goſpel, is the general <hi>offer</hi> of theſe termes, and ſalvation by them, unto all that come unto Chriſt, and Gods earneſt invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accept of it. The firſt is the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>way</hi> of life, and that the ſoul likes, and accepts and comes. This is the diſcovery of the <hi>perſons</hi> to whom this way is paſſable, and thoſe are all that exclude not themſelves. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come,</hi> Iſai. 55. 1. Apoc. 22. 17. <hi>Let whoever will, come.</hi> The <hi>Anſwer of the heart</hi> here, is, <hi>Lord, I come; Lord, I put in for a ſhare in this Offer.</hi> This is called, <hi>Laying hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hope that is ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6. 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Relyance or dependance.</hi> This is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Offer</hi> indeed (ſaith the ſoul) and I have put in for a ſhare in it: but may <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it.</hi> Yes, ſaith the Goſpel, and (there comes in the <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſeconding the <hi>Offer</hi> and <hi>Invitation)</hi> thou maiſt adventure thy ſoul on it: for God hath ſaid, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170084:154"/> 
                  <hi>who ever comes to Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> John 6. 37. That he that thirſting comes, <hi>ſhall eat that which is good, &amp;c.</hi> Iſai. 55. 1, 2, 3 <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. The <hi>anſwer of the heart</hi> here, is, <hi>Sink or ſwim, I will adventure my ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Promiſe; I will carry it to hell with me in my dying gripe, if I muſt periſh. Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith under affliction) <hi>Job</hi> 10. 13. This act is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually expreſſed by <hi>truſting in God,</hi> Epheſ. 1 12, 13. <hi>Truſting and ſtaying a mans ſelf on God,</hi> Iſai. 50. 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> A ſoul having gone thus far, the next queſtion is, But what if (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be many that come and claim an intereſt in Chriſt, that ſhall at laſt be caſt out, becauſe they do not indeed come and claim Chriſt as they ſhould) I ſay, What if I be found among them; and then I ſhal be <hi>aſhamed of my hopes,</hi> and my relyance at the laſt, when I have expected ſo much from it? Now to this the Scripture ſayes, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. John 3. 16. <hi>Whoever believeth ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hereby ſhall ye know that ye are paſſed from death to life, &amp;c,</hi> 1 John 3. 14. John 14. 21. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 119 6. The anſwer of the heart to this, is, <hi>Such an one am I;</hi> therefore my faith is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am under this condition or ſtate: <hi>I know that I am paſſed from death to life; I know that I am of God,</hi> 1 John 5. 19.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170084:155"/> 
                  <hi>I need not bee aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>third</hi> of theſe Acts, to wit, <hi>Relyance,</hi> is an act to be exerciſed perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in order to the getting the Teſtimony of the Spirit in the <hi>laſt, viz. Aſſurance;</hi> when Aſſurance (as moſt ordinarily it comes to paſs) is not enjoyed at the ſame time together with it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1 This is the advice. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50. 10. <hi>Let him truſt in the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> Who is he that is thus adviſed? <hi>One that walks in darkneſſe and ſees no light,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not aſſured that God is <hi>his God</hi> (though he be ſo;) he muſt <hi>ſtay upon his God;</hi> firſt he muſt lay <hi>claim to him as his God,</hi> and then <hi>ſtay,</hi> and <hi>depend,</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> upon him. I illuſtrate it thus, Suppoſe ſuch a friend as I before mentioned, that offers the higheſt acts of real friendſhip to all that <hi>come</hi> to him, <hi>accept</hi> of it, upon ſuch and ſuch termes, <hi>claim</hi> his favour, and <hi>rely on</hi> his promiſe. Which is the way for me to be aſſured that this man will be my friend in particular? Is it not this? to go to him and tell him, <hi>Sir, your publication of your good will encouraged me to accept your offer, emboldned me to claim an intereſt in your friendſhip, though neither your Proclamation, nor offer, nor Promiſe named me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And now</hi> (Sir) <hi>I rely upon your Promiſe to enterpoſe for me between me and Juſtice, to pay ſuch a debt for me; if you faile me, I am an undone man. I have ſuch</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:170084:155"/> 
                  <hi>an eſteem of your word, that I am reſolved I will adventure my ſelf upon it, and all that I am, though I know your mind no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me in particular; yet I cannot withal but deſire, that if you think fit, you will give me a particular aſſurance that I am accepted by you as one of thoſe to whom you ſtand ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, that by the knowledg of my particular obligations to you, I may be encouraged the more cheerfully to ſerve you, and to be the more heartily thankful.</hi> I appeal to all men, whether this bee not the likelieſt way to get a particular engagement from this man.</p>
               <p>Apply this to the caſe in hand, and you will ſee reaſon in my Direction to act <hi>reliance</hi> in order to <hi>Aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Beſides, <hi>Reliance</hi> frequently exerciſed will yeild <hi>Arguments of Aſſurance;</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being acted in <hi>particular caſes:</hi> as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe temptation, corruption, ſtraights. As though a man have no particular obligation from a friend, yet knowing his principles, that he never fails thoſe that depend on him, and having relyed upon him often, and found he hath not failed him at any time, at laſt he becomes aſſured that he will not. So ſeeing I know that God <hi>never faileth them that truſt in him,</hi> and I have found that he hath ſtood by me in many a ſad plunge of ſpirit, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of that and the like obligations, I hence argue, ſure he will never fail me. So the holy Prophet argues, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. And
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170084:156"/> ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. God <hi>hath delivered,</hi> God <hi>doth deliver,</hi> and God <hi>will deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Aſſurance is recovered the ſame way when it is loſt, wherein it is to be gotten when a man is utterly a ſtranger to it; and this I evidence thus. A ſoul in deſertion looks upon himſelf as having no grace at all, and therefore he doth act, and (if he can act no higher) wee adviſe him to act as if he begun all anew. This courſe were in vain, if not the ſame in both.</p>

Wee <hi>ask</hi> Counſel in Prayer, God <hi>anſwers</hi> in them; We <hi>ask</hi> ſtrength and peace in <hi>this,</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes anſwers of peace in <hi>them,</hi> and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in <hi>thankſgiving</hi> again. God in the Word <hi>tells</hi> us what he is <hi>offended at in us;</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it in Prayer, he aſſures us we are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We returne thanks in prayer again. And indeed, this is the way how to know Gods mind; as we know mans mind by deſiring a conference and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our doubts or diſſatisfactions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his anſwers when he gives them, or preſſing for them, when he denyes or eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf. Thus <hi>David</hi> uſed to <hi>enquire of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. And when he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in prayer, then he holds his peace, and waits to <hi>hear what God will ſay,</hi> Pſalm 85 8.</p>
               <p>1 Neglect not this way of conference with God. Eſpecially in the <hi>ſet ſeaſons</hi> thereof. They have a fancy among the Philoſophers, of two <hi>needles</hi> touched with the ſame <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> which being ſet in two <hi>Compaſſes,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170084:158"/> round with the letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> will conveigh intelligence from one friend to another at the greateſt diſtance. Thus each friend having recourſe to his own Compaſs at fixed times, ſhall find that as his <hi>friend at diſtance</hi> moves his needle to any letter, his <hi>own,</hi> (without any touch of his) will turne to the ſame; ſo that by putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thoſe letters, he may read his friends mind. I have not faith enough to believe the conceit; but I can make a good uſe of it in Spirituals, wherein I am ſure it is true. <hi>Gods</hi> heart and <hi>thine</hi> are touched with the ſame <hi>Loadſtone of love,</hi> and if thou at ſeaſons of conference ſhalt have recourſe to the <hi>nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4. 19</note> 
                  <hi>of thy heart,</hi> and by the experience of holy affections in prayer, ſhalt point out to God thy wants and burthens, the <hi>heart of God</hi> by a ſacred ſympathy, will work the ſame way, and copy out thy caſe in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and then it cannot be long ere his fatherly compaſſions ſet the <hi>needle of his affections</hi> a turning towards thee again, to produce a reciprocal aſſurance in thy heart by a like ſecret ſympathy. This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holdeth forth clearly. See <hi>Jer:</hi> 31, 18, 19, 20. There <hi>Ephraims needle</hi> firſt turnes in confeſſion, <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Gods needle</hi> falls to work preſently, to give him intelligence of <hi>Ephraims</hi> complaint, <hi>Surely, I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf.</hi> And when <hi>Ephraims</hi> ſtory is done, then God falls to turning <hi>his needle</hi> by way of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170084:158"/> anſwer to <hi>Ephraim, My bowels are troubled for him. Is Ephraim my dear ſon? Yes that he is,</hi> and he ſhall know it too, <hi>For ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill.</hi> Then comes the anſwer to <hi>Ephraims</hi> heart, <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence in the Text the Spirit, that is the <hi>witneſſe</hi> from God to us, is the <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> within us to God. The ſame Meſſenger that carries our <hi>Letters,</hi> brings our <hi>Anſwer, ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Oh Friends, you know not what miſchief Satan doth to you by cooling your hearts in prayer; nay, by prevailing with you onely to neglect a <hi>ſet time</hi> of prayer, publick or private. If you appoint a friend a ſet time of meeting and conference ſo often every day, and you fail him twice or thrice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (eſpecially when he knowes you have none but trifling buſineſſes to hinder you) how can you expect but that he ſhould ſerve you in the ſame kind? True, a man may lay bonds upon himſelf in appointment of times of duty, which (as he may order the matter; that is, if he lay them ſo upon himſelf as to pronounce it abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon any occaſion to over-ſlip that very time) may prove but ſnares to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle his conſcience: but yet on the other ſide; to ſet apart appointed hours for this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a convenient means to keep our heart from framing petty occaſions from hour to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170084:159"/> hour to put off the duty, and that with reſolution not to fail at the appointed time, but upon very weighty occaſions, and upon ſuch failing at any time, to reſolve to make up that defect doubly, as ſoon as the occaſion is over, ſure, is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable way for the getting and keeping acquaintance with God. And no queſtion if God find (as he knowes) that very ſlight occaſions divert us from meeting him at fit or ſet times, but he will be out of the way at other times, when our leaſure will ſerve us to ſeek him.</p>
               <p>But this by the way concerning ſet times of prayer. <note place="margin">2.</note> 2. A ſoul that wants the witneſſe of Gods Spirit, though he neglect not thoſe, yet he will not content himſelf with them; but he muſt now and then viſit the Throne of Grace in extraordinary wayes of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, adding <hi>faſting to prayer,</hi> and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole dayes in following hard after God. Certainly, this duty is much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among Chriſtians in theſe dayes, to what it hath been formerly, both in private and publick. Surely, when Gods Saints were more acquainted with it, there was far more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God then (I fear, if I may gheſs at others condition by mine owne) there now is.</p>
               <p>There be ſome <hi>Divels</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that wil not be caſt out without prayer and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mar. 9. 29. ſo may I ſay in this caſe, there be ſome <hi>doubts that will not be caſt out</hi> of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170084:159"/> ſoul till a man try this way? Not that faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adds any thing to prayer in it ſelfe, or by any proper efficiency of its own; but it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a man to humiliation, and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>In ſuch a caſe, commend thy condition to the publique prayers of the Church, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon days of ſolemn ſeeking God.

               </p>
               <p>It may be God expects you ſhould thus <hi>make many friends</hi> to ſpeak to him, that <hi>thanks</hi> may be <hi>rendred by many on your behalf,</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth himſelfe in a like caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11.) And neglect not to bee preſent as often as poſſibly thou canſt at the publick prayers of the Church, eſpecially ſuch as are put up in relation to thy caſe.

               <p>So in thy caſe, who knows whether God reſerves comfort for thee to be diſpenced in ſuch a way?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Every day</hi> the Saints of God (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially under bondage and darkneſſe) can finde <hi>occaſional times;</hi> to knock at the door of grace, when they are at leaſure from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary imployments.

               <p>THis aſſurance is promoted by <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe we call by the warrant of St. <hi>Paul the Apoſtle, ſeals,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is the <hi>perſonal ſeal,</hi> may make uſe of the Sacraments as the <hi>inſtrumental ſeals</hi> of this aſſurance.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> I mean not the repetition of it, which is a courſe ſome vain people are ſeduced unto, in hope to get comfort by it; but many have found it hath been an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of many ſad and fearfull Apoſtacies from the ſtanding Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo hath eaten out the heart of their love to, and zeal in following God in them, whiles their prejudices to their former <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> have cauſed prejudices againſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> that diſpenſed it, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wherein they received it, and ſo they have proceeded by degrees, (as finding no perſons or adminiſtrations free from excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to throw off all ways of worſhip and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170084:161"/> duty altogether, which when they have been made to ſee the evil of their way (as it may by Gods goodneſſe come to paſſe, though ſeldome it do) they find all the peace they got in thoſe ways was but meer impoſture.</p>
               <p>But I mean, the renewed meditation of the ſpiritual ſignification, and end of that ſeal of the Covenant, which (having been applied to thee in thy infancy) becomes of force to thee as ſoon as thou comeſt to know and to accept of the Covenant in the ſerious choyce and intention of thy heart.</p>
               <p>One main intent of Baptiſme is, to work an aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne, by the <hi>ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt:</hi> And herein it anſwers to Circumciſion. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a <hi>ſeal of the Righteouſneſs, which is by faith, i. e.</hi> of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt made ours by faith for juſtification.</p>
               <p>'Tis called <hi>the baptiſme of repentance, for remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> that is, ſignifying and ſealing forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a penitent ſinner. Now if a man <note place="margin">Mark 1. 3.</note> have not only a great Landlords <hi>word,</hi> but his <hi>ſeal.</hi> to aſſure him of ſuch an eſtate, he is confident thereupon, to abide a trial at law before a juſt Judge: ſo if thou make a right uſe of this ſeal, thou mayſt plead it whenever Conſcience ſhall ſit upon thee, and call into queſtion thy Spiritual or eternal condition.</p>
               <p>Think now and then upon thy baptiſme
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170084:162"/> and the end of it, and labour from thence to riſe to a belief of the performance of that to thee <hi>in truth,</hi> which was <hi>ſacramentally</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to thee in the <hi>ſigne.</hi> And know this, That laying hold of the graces promiſed, and ſealed in Baptiſme, upon the terms convenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, gives thee a juſt and legal claim to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Object.</label> But this Sacrament was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to me in my <hi>infancy,</hi> and therefore I want the lively, and ſenſible application of the element to me, which might poſſibly (if it were now to be done) prove effectual to give me this aſſurance. What uſe can I make of ſuch a paſt Sacrament? Were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to re-new it?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw</label> Thou mayſt make the ſame uſe of it as the Jews did of circumciſion, although many years after. The Jews children no more ſaw their own <hi>circumciſion</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, then thou didſt thy <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Object.</label> Yea: but the <hi>mark of Circumciſion</hi> (ſaythe Anabaptiſts) <hi>was viſible afterwards,</hi> and ſo though they were circumciſed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, yet they might know that they were ſo, otherwiſe then by bare relation. But I know that I am baptized merely by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friends or the Regiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> The Jewes, when men, might ſee that their <hi>foreskin had been cut off:</hi> but that it was done in a ſacramental way, they knew onely by relation, as we have our Baptiſme. For how did a Jew know that he was borne of Jewiſh Parents, and not of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:170084:162"/> poſterity, or <hi>Eſaus,</hi> among whom circumciſion continued, when the Covenant was removed from them, but by tradition? But I will rell thee how thou ſhalt improve even thy Infant Baptiſme. Whenever then thou ſeeſt that ſacrament adminiſtred upon others, reflect upon thy ſelf, and draw an Argument of Aſſurance from it thus. <hi>Loe here</hi> (my ſoul) <hi>the bloud of Chriſt (in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water) not only powred out, but apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to yonder little one. And hath not God done as much for me? And hath he thus ſealed to me the promiſe of pardon, and ſhall I not believe it? Have not I performed (by his grace) my</hi>

                  <hi>part of the Covenant, in the anſwer of a good conſcience, ſeriouſly deſiring and reſolving to take him for my God, and do my duty to him to the utmoſt, in the ſtrength of Chriſt? And ſhall I doubt his performance on his part? Did not God ſhew his willingneſs to receive mee into his favour, and pardon my ſins, when he was ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to ſeal his Covenant to me in my very infancy? Sure, that was a great mercy to me, that God afforded me that ſeal then, whereas if I had lived unbaptiſed to theſe years, poſſibly my ſcrupulous ſpirit would have kept me from it altogether, as being unfit to receive</hi> it <hi>(as now it</hi>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> Hereto I anſwer <hi>Negatively.</hi> That propoſition which is the ground of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake is but miſtaken for truth; to wit, <hi>That none is a fit receiver of the Sacrament of the Lords Body and Bloud, but one that is certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Teſtimony of the Spirit that he is a Child of God.</hi> This is that that puzzles and embroyls many a poor ſoul, that he knowes not which way to take, between ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods <hi>invitation</hi> in refuſing to <hi>come,</hi> and againſt the <hi>inſtitution</hi> in coming <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I hope to ſpeak a word ſatisfactorily in this caſe. That this is a miſtaken principle I prove by this Argument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>actual aſſurance</hi> mentioned, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired under any of thoſe things wherein we are to examine our ſelves before we come, therefore 'tis not neceſſary to make a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
               <p>The graces to bee examined (among the Proteſtant Divines) are uſually theſe four, Knowledge, Faith, Charity, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Under Knowledge, Charity, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I believe no man comprehends the certainty of his intereſt in Chriſt; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces (in their natures) quite different from it, though poſſibly in ſome higher act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them it be ſuppoſed. I dare not think there can be none of theſe without Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>All the doubt is concerning Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170084:164"/> the Faith required to the receiving the Lords Supper, be not <hi>Faith of perſwaſion,</hi> that I am a Child of God, from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>I conceive the Faith required to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lords Supper, is no more but the having <hi>accepted</hi> the terms of Salvation revealed through Chriſt, my having <hi>claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> my ſhare in the free offer thereof in the Goſpel, and my <hi>reliance</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods faithfulneſſe in the making that claim good unto me. And if I can find theſe acts have ſeriouſly (to my utmoſt knowledg and ſearch) been performed by me, I need examine no further whether I have ſufficient Faith to fit me for the Sacrament And my grounds are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe by theſe acts there is a real ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which the Scripture expreſſeth by <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>truſting in him,</hi> as was before ſhewn: and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which is expreſſed by <hi>receiving him;</hi> and <note place="margin">Pſalm 2. 12 John 1. 12</note> in theſe acts the nature of faith, as it applies Chriſt for juſtification is ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now thoſe that <hi>come to Chriſt</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to have the witneſſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their heart that they are Chriſts.</p>
               <p>For <hi>reſt,</hi> or peace of Conſcience (which is the immediate fruit of that aſſuring Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit) is promiſed as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of <hi>coming to Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 11. 28. and <hi>becoming the children of God,</hi> (which is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170084:164"/> leſſe then <hi>knowing</hi> we are ſo) is ſet down as the conſequent of <hi>receiving Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 1. 20 And therefore (by the way) to <hi>receive Chriſt,</hi> is not to <hi>know</hi> that I <hi>am</hi> a child of God, but to <hi>apply my ſelf</hi> to him, that I may be ſo. And as for truſting or believing in Chriſt, that it is truly done without actual aſſurance, is clear, becauſe truſting in Chriſt the object of the Goſpel, is ſpoken of by way of diſtinction from this ſealing or aſſuring act of the Spirit, as that which goes before it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.

If hereupon I come to the Sacrament, deſiring God to ſeal to this Promiſe which I lay hold upon, I cannot be ſaid to come unworthily, though I have no witneſſe in my heart from the Spirit that I belong to Chriſt. I told you before, that it is the claiming of Chriſt, and ſtanding to that claim, and being reſolved to adventure my ſoul upon it, that entitles me to him, and that that entitles me to Chriſt, gives me a right to the Sacrament, as I ſaid but now, upon the former head.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Sacramental <hi>Examination</hi> doth not preſuppoſe a neceſſity of a <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>aſſured knowledg,</hi> that I have the graces which I examine my ſelf for. But only a finding thoſe <hi>acts</hi> in my ſelf which ordinarily thoſe graces appear in (my heart dealing plainly and faithfully with it ſelf in the ſearch) and my earneſt deſire and endeavour that they may be true, though at preſent I ſee not that they are true, ſuppoſing that I ſee nothing
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170084:165"/> of weight (according to the rule of the Word) to judg them falſe. Nay, if I ſhould ſee cauſe to condemne thoſe former acts, which I took for gracious, as <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound;</hi> yet upon that conviction, if I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly labour to ſet them <hi>right</hi> now, I ought not to keep from the Sacrament for that, but to draw nigh, and from thence to expect ſtrength to proſper my endeavours, and give me evidence (in Gods time) of the reality of them. If this were not true, then every Chriſtian under deſertion and doubting muſt be excluded from the Sacrament. And ſurely, if ſo, the fitteſt perſons that can be will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred; there being none more fit for a ſtrengthning Ordinance then ſuch ſouls. To exemplifie the preſent caſe. A man examines his faith, repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he finds ſome ſuch acts as look like the acts of thoſe graces yet he doubts whether they were true or no; he therefore examines <hi>faith</hi> by the rule of the Word, <hi>purifying the heart, working by love, over-coming the world; Repentance,</hi> by <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, of all ſin, ſincere endeavors of future obedience;</hi> ſome ſuch things as theſe he ſees no ſufficient ground to conclude he hath not; and yet he thinks he may deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thinking that he hath them.</p>
               <p>Here is his caſe: What ſhall this man do? Shall he come to the <hi>Supper</hi> or no?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Yes. For I am fit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when my heart doth not upon good grounds <hi>condemn</hi> me: Unwarrantable Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170084:166"/> do not unfit me: it is not required that my heart do alwayes <hi>clearly abſolve me.</hi> See what <hi>John</hi> faith in this caſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If our hearts condemne us not,</hi> (he doth not ſay if they <hi>actually abſolve us,</hi> many needleſſe Scruples may hinder that) but if they <hi>condemn us not,</hi> (it muſt be meant of the conſcience enlightned by the Word: An ignorant wordleſſe conſcience its abſolution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is nothing in this caſe, but an enlightned conſcience) <hi>then have we confidence; i. e.</hi> ground of confidence, <hi>towards God.</hi> And by conſequence ground of approach to thoſe Seals in which this confidence is beſtowed, and encreaſed.</p>
               <p>2 It is not neceſſary to a worthy partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Lords Supper, that I be able ſatisfactorily to evidence to my owne heart the truth of <hi>every grace</hi> required thereunto. <hi>One</hi> grace ſometimes may be more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then <hi>another.</hi> And it is ſufficient it I can ſee <hi>any thing</hi> in my ſelf of the <hi>new creature,</hi> though I know not how to improve it by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to prove ſuch or ſuch a grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For example, ſometimes <hi>repentance</hi> may be more conſpicuous to a man then <hi>faith,</hi> ſometimes <hi>love</hi> more viſible then <hi>both.</hi> ſometimes a man may be able to ſee <hi>neither</hi> of them all diſtinctly, yet he ſees ſomething which he cannot but acknowledg is a fruit of a <hi>mighty and ſupernatural change;</hi> and this change, he finds, he cannot reſt till it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and improved to greater perfection
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170084:166"/> If he can ſee nothing elſe, yet he finds <hi>earneſt and hearty deſires</hi> after Chriſt, not only as a fountaine of <hi>pardoning,</hi> but alſo of <hi>purging</hi> grace. Theſe deſires (as far as he can judg) are not <hi>counterfeit,</hi> though many times <hi>weak.</hi> Now in ſuch a caſe as this, the ſoul muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Chriſt hath promiſed not to <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> Though a mans grace be very infirm (if it be not a <hi>ſtaff</hi> but a <hi>reed,</hi> and a <hi>reed</hi> too not firm, but <hi>bruiſed,)</hi> and though the kindlings of grace be but in <hi>ſmoaking flax,</hi> (a Metaphor taken from thoſe that kindle a fire, that put ſome pilled ſtalks of flax or ſtraw, or ſome ſuch combuſtible thing under the wood to make it burn, which if it be moiſt will not flame out by and by, but ſmoak a while, and then kindle) though grace be but yet an <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi> as <hi>fire</hi> in <hi>ſmoaking flax,</hi> which a man can ſcarce tel whether it wil burn or no: yet God will not quench, that is, he will <hi>make much</hi> of it (as a ſervant doth of a little ſpark of fire in a wiſp of ſtraw) and <hi>gently blow it up</hi> till it flame, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42. 3. He is to conſider, moreover, that he ought to conclude from theſe ſmal meaſures (as far as he is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly perſwaded that they are true) that though he cannot ſee faith, repentance, love, yet where theſe deſires are, they are good ſignes of a gracious change, though yet but in the beginning, and a gracious change comprehends every grace in kind; and it concerns him to come to the Sacrament to promote it.</p>

                  <hi>of the Spirit of God to the ſoul in a witneſſing way, and follow them by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Prayer.</hi> Sometimes the witneſſe of the Spirit is not <hi>full</hi> and <hi>through</hi> to the ſatisfaction of all our doubts, yet it ſpeaks <hi>ſomething</hi> tending that way: it ſpeaks many things <hi>ſeverally</hi> and by <hi>parcels,</hi> which laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether would amount to a ful Teſtimony. Now in ſuch caſes a ſoul muſt be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take and improve the leaſt <hi>hints</hi> of the Spirit. As in an <hi>humane Teſtimony,</hi> the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that witneſſe in a caſe before a Judge, do not all ſpeak point-blank to the caſe in queſtion, but ſometimes very faintly, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly, and imperfectly. Now a good Judg in ſuch a caſe, doth not ſlight ſuch Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as come not full up to a buſineſſe, but
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170084:168"/> obſerves and retaines in memory every thing that is depoſed, though very defective as to a full proof; and at laſt, what one teſtimony did not ſufficiently clear <hi>in terminis,</hi> many teſtimonyes will make up a full proof of, if laid together by a skilful and judicious Lawyer.</p>
               <p>This Art we find the Church uſing in deſertion. <hi>Cant.</hi> 29. There ſhe diſcovers Chriſt firſt at a diſtance, <hi>leaping upon the Mountains,</hi> removing the great impediments to the manifeſtation of himſelf; ſuppoſe <hi>conquering mountainous corruptions, and mountainous temptations;</hi> ſuppoſe, <hi>deadneſſe and flatneſſe of heart in duty, &amp;c.</hi> which looks like a <hi>mountain of ſeparation</hi> betweene Chriſt and the ſoul, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. ſhe finds her ſelf unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly enlarged and opened in her addreſſes to him: Thence ſhe concludes, he is a coming, he <hi>prepares his way</hi> (as 'tis ſaid in another caſe of <hi>John)</hi> he makes every <hi>mountain and hill low.</hi> Iſai. 40. 4. and <hi>every valley he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts,</hi> that he may make his way ſmoother; then ſhe eſpies him <hi>behind the wall, looking in through the latteſs;</hi> neerer then he was, but yet he ſtands much undiſcovered: the <hi>wall</hi> and the <hi>latteſs</hi> here (it may be) are the obſtacles of <hi>prejudice,</hi> and <hi>doubting,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in our own hearts,</hi> which keep us from ſeeing Chriſt clearly when he comes to us; but yet ſomething of Chriſt ſhines through them, and the Church takes notice of theſe dark approaches, puts a <hi>[Behold]</hi> upon
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170084:168"/> them all. <hi>Behold, he cometh, behold, he ſtandeth behind our wall.</hi> And at laſt he calls her forth into a pleaſant converſe and walk with him, <hi>v.</hi> 10. 11. and there fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth himſelfe to her.</p>
               <p>If God write thee a <hi>love-letter,</hi> though the hand in which it is written be but uneven, and it be not to be read but by <hi>ſpelling</hi> every word; wilt thou not take that pains, that thou mayſt underſtand it? The ſpirits teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony when it comes under Gods hand and ſeal to the heart, is oftentimes ſo obſcurely written, that a man is fain to <hi>ſpell</hi> and <hi>put together</hi> many words, experiences, providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make it up. However, the evidence may be ſufficient, that is pick'd out of them altogether.

               <p n="2">2. Nor will the <hi>glory of God</hi> permit him to ſeal aſſuring evidences of his love to ſuch, whoſe converſation would reproach him, for admitting them to ſo much intimacy.

               <p>3. Labour to accept of, claim, and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jeſus for Salvation, on the termes of the Goſpel. 'Tis impoſſible a ſoul ſhould go to Hell, that can <hi>cling faſt</hi> to any promiſe, truly apprehended according to the intention of the Goſpel.

There are alſo two expreſſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. very full to this purpoſe.

               <p>To this purpoſe, and in the ſame expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Apoſtle alſo ſpeaks to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 21, 22. (where you may alſo take notice of one clauſe that confirms the expoſition before-given of <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. and that is this.) <hi>v.</hi> 21. He tells them that the confirmation of al the promiſes, both as preached by Miniſters and received by hearers, dependeth upon the merit of Chriſt. <hi>He ſtabliſheth us in Chriſt,</hi> i. e. by uniting us to him, by the communication of the Spirit in
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170084:174"/> and through them, from the Father. Now from the Spirit, the Apoſtle drawes two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to aſſure them; the firſt is its <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work,</hi> (and that is the matter of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular aſſurance, as I told you formerly) in the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>who hath annointed us.</hi> Now although there be an annointing with gladneſſe as well as grace, yet the annointing with grace is here meant, becauſe it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniſhed from that annointing by an <hi>[alſo]</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

So then the <hi>witneſſe</hi> of the Spirit, is the <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> that confirmes all the promiſes to us: <hi>they are yea &amp; amen,</hi> ſure and firm <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> by vertue of his purchaſe, <hi>propter pretium ſolutum,</hi> as a barg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n is to the purchaſer upon conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>price,</hi> whether any man think them ſo or no: but 'tis the <hi>Spirit</hi> that makes them ſure <hi>to the parties</hi> for whom they are purchaſed, <hi>per poſſeſſionem inchoatam,</hi> by an inchoated poſſeſſion, as the Jewes were put in poſſeſſion of the lard of <hi>Canaan</hi> by a <hi>few cluſters of grapes;</hi> and a man enters upon a great eſtate by the cutting of a <hi>turfe upon the land.</hi> Aſſurance is a <hi>turfe of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and this is put into our hands by the Spirit. I could adde many more places; I will name at preſent onely one more, and that is Rom. 5. 5. <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:170084:175"/> 
                  <hi>our hearts by the holy Ghoſt that is given to us.</hi> And what is the fruit of that abundant <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad of the Spirit?</hi> Hence it comes to paſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that our <hi>hope makes not aſhamed.</hi> If one man build upon the Teſtimony of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in buſineſſes of concernment, and when he comes to produce him in open Court, his Teſtimony come not up to the buſineſſe in hand, or his Teſtimony appear ſuſpicious, a man doth not only loſe his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but his <hi>Hope</hi> alſo, and is publickly <hi>ſhamed</hi> for his confidence in ſuch a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But (ſaith the Apoſtle) if the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ſhed abroad the love of God in our hearts, i. e.</hi> plentifully aſſure us of it, the hope that is grounded thereupon, will never make us aſhamed. His Teſtimony will bear a man and his cauſe up before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt, or his Deputy, Conſcience, whenever it ſhall bee called in queſtion, whether here or hereafter, at the great day.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And herein conſider two things,</p>
               <p>I. The <hi>matter</hi> of the Aſſurance, which the Spirit gives regularly, is a <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> A Demonſtration (ſay Logicians) is, <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmus Scientificus,</hi> an Argument that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a certain knowledg of the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Demonſtration is of two ſorts; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>Why.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) <hi>That</hi> a thing is. I can certainly prove, that the tree <hi>lives,</hi> becauſe it <hi>growes,</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:170084:175"/> and brings forth leaves and fruit; that a man is in a preſent good <hi>temper</hi> of body, becauſe he hath a good <hi>pulſe;</hi> and this is called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratio ab effectu,</hi> or <hi>Demonſtratio</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus the Spirit certainly proves that I am a child of God by the <hi>Effects</hi> of Adoption; thus, <hi>He that is led by the Spirit of God, is a Son of God: But this man is led by the Spirit of God; Therefore he is the Son of God.</hi> Here is a certain Teſtimony. The <hi>Major</hi> of this Argument, <hi>[He that is led by the Spirit of God, is the Son of God]</hi> is plain Scripture, and ſets forth the proper <hi>effect</hi> of being the Son of God, <hi>to be led by the Spirit,</hi> or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> (or ſecond Propoſition) is true by experience, which I ſee by the ſpiritual ſenſe which, the Spirit gives me; and therefore the concluſion is demonſtratively true, <hi>Such a man is a Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Why it is.</hi> And this alſo hath place here. I can certainly and demonſtratively prove, that 'tis day, becauſe the <hi>Sun ſhines,</hi> that makes day. So if the Spirit conclude thus, <hi>He that is begotten of God, is the Son of God; But ſuch a man is begotten of God; Therefore, &amp;c.</hi> The Argument is <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative,</hi> and producing (where the Spirit ſets it home) a certain <hi>aſſent.</hi> This is <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that concludes the <hi>Effect</hi> from the <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> But here is a Queſtion, <hi>Whether a man may be aſſured of his good eſtate by an</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:170084:176"/> 
                  <hi>Argument, à priori?</hi> that is, by that which conſtitutes him in ſuch an eſtate; as (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) <hi>Whether a man may know that he is a child of God from the very act of his converſion which conſtitutes him ſuch?</hi> or rather, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his only evidence that he is a child of God, be not from the effects of his relation to God, and that converting grace that made him ſo? becauſe grace in its firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Hereunto I anſwer in a word,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Spirit may and doth ſometimes immediately teſtifie, or mediately but not by Argument; (as hath been declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) then he can aſſure a man without the preſent uſe of either of theſe means to prove it ſo, that he can (if hee pleaſe) work an immediate conſent to this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at firſt converſion; I am at this inſtant begotten of God, which is the Minor Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the Syllogiſme, which is an implicite aſſurance, that ſuch an one is a child of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit teſtifying, as he ordinarily doth <hi>(i. e.</hi> by Arguments) is at liberty to uſe his own Arguments to ſatisfie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and the evidence or in-evidence of the Propoſitions ſhall not hinder the aſſent of the ſoul to the concluſion, if the Spirit give light to them.

                  <hi>work, God is now begetting true grace in thy heart, therefore thou art a child of God;</hi> I know not why it ſhould not be a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative</hi> evidence; becauſe the truth of this Concluſion, <hi>Thou regenerated perſon art a child of God,</hi> depends on the truth of this Propoſition, <hi>Every one whom God begets to a life of grace is a child of God.</hi> And ſo certainly from Scripture, The <hi>Aſſumption, But thou art one whom God at this inſtant hath begotten to a life of grace,</hi> is true, by the evidence of the Spirit, teſtifying to a mans own ſpirit, who by ſpiritual ſenſe is enabled to feel that work upon himſelf. And therefore this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be a ſure evidence, though it be <hi>à priori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet would I be underſtood warily in what <note place="margin">Cautions.</note> I ſay herein. 1. I only affirm a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of receiving Aſſurance this way, not an <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi> or <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe of the Spirit towards all or any that I know in particular; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that which I hear oftentimes pleaded for by ſome of Gods precious ones, whoſe experience in this ſecret work of the Spirit may be more then mine; I cannot ſay leſs then this: Yet for the ſake of others of an Antinomian ſpirit, that reject all trial by the <hi>effects</hi> of Regeneration, which I ſtil affirm to be the uſual rode. way of the Spirit in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Aſſurance, I dare not ſay more.</p>
               <p>2 Remember that before I told you, that <hi>habitual</hi> and fixed, ſettled, permanent, <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Aſſurance, is collected from the fruits of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170084:177"/> the Spirit that follow the firſt act of uniting grace; though a preſent, temporary, actual Aſſurance, may poſſibly be given in the very moment of actual union between Chriſt and the ſoul. And therefore it concernes every one that hath been ſo aſſured at firſt, not to reſt there, but to endeavour to ratifie and habituate that aſſurance to himſelfe by Arguments <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from the effects of that converting grace which he hath for the preſent had actual Aſſurance of.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>formal act</hi> of Aſſurance (as it is the work of the Spirit teſtifying our Sonſhip from ſuch Arguments as have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or without them) is likewiſe certaine, and evidencing, if we conſider the witneſſe who thus teſtifies, the <hi>Holy Spirit of God.</hi> In whom there are theſe things conſiderable, which make a witneſſe credible.

Thou knoweſt no good in thy ſelf, but the Spirit of God knowes it, becauſe he is the Author of it.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170084:178"/> He knowes all thy <hi>ſins,</hi> and therefore when he brings under <hi>Bondage,</hi> he can and doth ſet all our <hi>ſecret ſins in order before our eyes.</hi> A man ſees himſelf by a new light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. So in <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> he gives a man a clear ſight of that in himſelf, which before hee could not ſee.

               <p>2 <hi>Faithfulneſſe.</hi> A man that is not known to be of ſufficient credit for honeſty and faithfulneſſe in his words, is not admitted for a ſufficient witneſſe; but an honeſt man that makes conſcience of his words, is credible in every Court and caſe. The Spirit is ſuch a witneſſe, <hi>John</hi> 15. 16.

The Spirit beareth witneſſe of the <hi>bloud</hi> of Juſtification, and the <hi>water</hi> of Sanctification; but how are we aſſured his witneſſe is true?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth, becauſe the <hi>Spirit is Truth.</hi> The Spirit will never be induced to give a falſe evidence. He never calls <hi>good evil,</hi> or <hi>evil good.</hi> The ſtrength of divine conſolations lies in this, that it depends upon the credit of God, who cannot poſſibly lye. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:170084:178"/>
               <p>3 He is <hi>diſengaged.</hi> And that adds a third particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To the value of his Teſtimony. The Spirit is no way a party with them for whom he teſtifies; ſtands in no relation to us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he aſſumes us into communion with himſelf of meer grace, gets no benefit to himſelf by his Teſtimony, even the glory that he gets by it adds nothing to him. If <hi>our own hearts</hi> witneſſe <hi>alone,</hi> they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and may flatter themſelves. If <hi>Satan</hi> witneſſe, he is alſo a party, in that he ſeeks his own end; <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal undoing of poor ſouls with himſelf by ſuch a deluſive comfort.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Nay more, the Spirits Teſtimony is the Teſtimony of one whom we have often reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, grieved, vexed, quenched. Now though a perſons teſtimony whom a man hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, avail not <hi>againſt him</hi> in Law, yet a diſcontented perſons Teſtimony <hi>for him</hi> with whom he is offended, is of great force. And yet is the Spirits Teſtimony even againſt a man no leſſe true, becauſe the ſinner ſtands as an enemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe <hi>partly,</hi> that Teſtimony is for his good; and <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe (though an enemy, yet he hath often laboured to perſwade the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt whom he witneſſeth, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, which takes away all ſuſpicion of malice from the Spirits condemning teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.) But I here ſhew only this, that if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a ſtate, and acts of enmity, the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170084:179"/> Spirits Teſtimony be valid againſt a man; it muſt needs be more probable when it ſpeaks for him, though actually offended by him. So much for the proof.</p>

                  <hi>Whether this Evidence be ſuch, as to admit no doubting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1) The Teſtimony of the Spirit is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>full</hi> and plain to the point; ſometimes it is but <hi>partial,</hi> and ſpeakes ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, but not throughly to ſatisfaction. A full Teſtimony is a <hi>ſatisfying teſtimony,</hi> and cannot at the ſame time admit of <hi>partial doubting,</hi> This is called <hi>full aſſurance.</hi> But <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> a <hi>partial evidence</hi> may admit <hi>partial diffidence</hi> There is therefore a <hi>rejoycing with fear and trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. 11. though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it may bee ſufficient at another time to evidence; yet it will not do it then.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:170084:179"/>
               <p n="2">2) <hi>Full aſſurance,</hi> ariſing from an <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>home-teſtimony</hi> of the Spirit at <hi>one time,</hi> may admit ſuch meaſures of doubting and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>another time,</hi> as may raiſe ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt it ſelf, Sometimes a Saint is at the top of the ladder of Aſſurance, ready to put his foot on the threſhold of heaven it ſelf; and at other times under ſuch a ſad pang of doubting and diffidence, as brings him to the very brink of hel. See <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 27. 1. &amp; 4. 6. &amp; 51. 8, 11. &amp; 42. &amp; 43. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; 13. 1. and <hi>Job, Job</hi> 19. 25. &amp; 6. 4.</p>
               <p>But this ariſeth not from defect in the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> but in the mans <hi>uſe</hi> of it. If I have never ſo good an evidence, and lay it out of the way, or blot it; the fault is not in my Evidence, if the Title be queſtionable again which it confirms. And the truth is, very few of Gods people enjoy an un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted actual Aſſurance. Indeed 'tis ſuch a ſparkle of glory that a ſoul cannot bear it. And as a Teſtimony, though never ſo full to a Cauſe, ſo that in <hi>one</hi> Court it carries the judgment without farther ado, may be upon review in another Court called into queſtion again, and be perplexed ſo by a cunning Lawyer, that it may ſeem queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able again: So the evidence of the Spirit, that once gave full aſſurance in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may by Satan be brought to the Court of ſenſe and reaſon, and made diſputable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Yet as to <hi>habitual aſſurance,</hi> it is true, that it can never be quite <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> by
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170084:180"/> doubting. It may be <hi>dipp'd,</hi> but not <hi>drown'd:</hi> It may be in a <hi>ſwoune,</hi> but not <hi>dye.</hi> A Saint may ſay to Satan when he tryumphs moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his aſſurance, as the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7, 8 9. <hi>Rejoyce not over me, &amp;c. when I am in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> God hath promiſed it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57 15, 16, 17. <hi>Heavineſs may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,</hi> Pſal 306.</p>
               <p>And indeed, Aſſurance being Gods <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Earneſt,</hi> if this <hi>gift</hi> of God be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>repentance,</hi> neither is his <hi>Covenant</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life and glory irrevocable. If God <hi>recal</hi> his <hi>Earneſt,</hi> he <hi>recants</hi> his <hi>bargain;</hi> as the taking an earneſt back again among m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yet let me not herein be miſtaken I would <note place="margin">Caution.</note> not be conceived to affirm, that a child of God always recover his Aſſurance again after loſs, in this life, in as full a meaſure as he once had it. A man may loſe his Aſſurance for his ill managing of it, and poſſibly ſuch may be the hainouſneſs of ſuch a miſcariage, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to let him lye long under <hi>broken bones;</hi> and whenever by renewed repentance he recovers it, he may juſtly withdraw from him ſome meaſures of that boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his preſence, which he had before. Nay, I know not why a true child of God, may not after loſt Aſſurance (if loſt in ſuch a way of provocation on his part) go <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his dayes,</hi> and hardly ever be able to <note place="margin">Iſai. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1 It is undoubtedly true, that Satan may ſo transform himſelf into an Angel of light, as to ſuggeſt to a man a certain perſwaſion of his own good condition. He is a <hi>lying ſpirit in the mouth</hi> of falſe Prophets and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with plauſible Doctrines and comfortable dreames, where with they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce peace to thoſe to whom the Lord ſaith, There is no peace.

               <p>1 I ſhall not here ſpeak much of thoſe <hi>ſudden irradiations</hi> of joy and comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he can fill men: only thus much, that

Now thoſe exſtacies proceed originally from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing and diſcolouring the phantaſie, that it may apprehend objects as he thinks fit to repreſent them. And no queſtion he may thus abuſe the fantaſie by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſe matter of comfort and joy, and ſet it home with ſo ſtrong an appearing evidence, that a man may verily think that it comes from God himſelf. Certainly, Satan, if (as was aboveſaid) he can <hi>transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> can ſecond theſe deluſions with <hi>viſions</hi> of an heavenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: poſſibly he may uſurp the name of Chriſt himſelf. I knew ſuch a caſe once in mine own experience. A woman not till that time noted to have had any ordinary <note place="margin">At <hi>Pool</hi> about ten yeers ſince.</note> proportion of knowledg, on a ſudden in child bed, is taken with abundance of joy, and Chriſt himſelf (as ſhe fancied) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, giving her a revelation againſt Infant Baptiſm, and perfuming her, of which ſhe was ſo confident, that ſhe would ask thoſe that were about her, whether they did not ſmel thoſe perfumes? I that had a little before ſpoken againſt Anabaptiſtical revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was ſent for to be confuted by ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an example, and ſhe told me as much. I gave her good advice; told a friend, I
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170084:183"/> ſuſpected an impoſture, and departed. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days after, the woman was grown perfectly diſtracted, and then the Devill put on his own blacks, and appeared in his own colours, and ſhe ſmelt him in every thing, and her ſweet perfumes ended in filthy ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have before ſhewn you the rules by which you may judge of ſuch <hi>immediate,</hi> and <hi>reaſonleſſe raptures of aſſurance.</hi> I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adde here, If you will diſcern them, mark the end of them for which they are given.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Que.</label> How ſhall I know that, will you ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Thus. Obſerve what is infuſed <hi>with</hi> them. Satan ſeldome uſeth this Art to any ſoul, but he withall infuſeth ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous <hi>doctrine</hi> or other, or ſtirs up to ſome or other <hi>irregular practice.</hi> The End of that dealing of his with the party before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was to ſcruple her in point of <hi>Infant-Baptiſme</hi> (as ſhe confeſſed to me;) and his end, in others, is to propagate one error or other, as appears in theſe days of deluſion by ordinary experience. A like revelation there was in theſe parts lately (concerning which more may be ſaid ſhortly in print) to perſwade a woman to leave her husband, who by that very ſuggeſtion diſcovered it to be a deluſion, becauſe it was quite contrary to the word.</p>
               <p>Now a Chriſtian muſt be ſo confirmed in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170084:183"/> the <hi>fundamental points</hi> of Religion, and ſo well ſatisfied in all things that concerne the practice of Godlineſſe, that he ſhould be able even hereby to diſcover Satans impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, by the Rule before I laid down, <hi>[The Spirit of God always moveth according to the Word.]</hi> In a word, you may do well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre to ſuch an evidence. 'Tis not good to be too haſty in owning ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſwaſions at the firſt daſh, as we ſay. A man offends not, that <hi>rejoyceth</hi> under them with <hi>trembling.</hi> If they come in ſeaſonably, to encourage me to any unqueſtionably good duty. I may (at preſent) act in the ſtrength of them. But afterwards, I may ſafely deſire an evidence from a known rule, whereby I may regularly be certified that they are indeed from God. Nor will ſuch a ſuſpenſion of my full aſſent to them, bee charged upon me as any <hi>affront</hi> to the Spirit of God (ſuppoſing him to be indeed the Author of them) or as an act of <hi>unbelief;</hi> but will be kindly taken, as an act of holy <hi>warineſſe,</hi> proceeding from a ſoul, that puts a due va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation upon the <hi>word,</hi> and deſires (as it ought) to make it in all things a <hi>light to its feet, and a lantern to its path. Pſalm</hi> 119. 105.</p>
               <p>God himſelfe hath told me, that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word is a <hi>ſurer word of propheſie</hi> then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19 and he tells me moreover, that I <hi>do well to take heed to it, as to a light ſhining in a dark place.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:170084:184"/>
               <p>2. Nor ſhall I tell you at large, How far Satan may concurre in giving aſſurance from <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>ſignes</hi> (though certainly he may do much this way:) or how far he may miſapply <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe to delude men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a falſe peace (though this he may do alſo:) The joy of the cloſe <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and of the meere civill <hi>Juſticiary,</hi> are evidences of this impoſture every day to be found, almoſt in every Congregation where the word is preached in a convincing ſearching way; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch perſon hath his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, his <hi>preſervative</hi> or <hi>Antidote</hi> of this kind, by which he keeps the word of God at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from his heart, when it approacheth with conviction of ſin. Moſt of both ſorts can plead good deſires, love to the brethren, ſtrictneſſe in religious duties, and moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though in all theſe they be miſerably miſtaken, yet (how ever) for the preſent theſe g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounds ſtop the mouth of conſcience, and give a preſent repulſe to the power of a ſhaking ſermon: we will take theſe things for granted</p>
               <p>2. It is as undoubtedly true, that (Satan thus miſrepreſenting Arguments) a mans <hi>own ſpirit</hi> may conſent to him and make uſe of them, and ſo by deluded Reaſon argue himſelf into a ſtrong perſwaſion that he is a child of God; when there is no ſuch matter. Nay, I doubt not, but the very ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which delude <hi>one</hi> man in this caſe, may truly ſatisfie <hi>another,</hi> and the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170084:184"/> of the ſame Scriptures, (Satan playing the Sophiſter whith his reaſon) may give a falſe perſwaſion to <hi>one</hi> man, which by the convincing evidence of the Spirit may give a ſound aſſurance to <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let me not here be miſtaken. I ſay not that theſe Arguments, and Scriptures may <note place="margin">Caution.</note> be managed the <hi>ſame way</hi> in both. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>concluſion</hi> is falſe, which in a deluſive aſſurance is to be inferred, there muſt alſo be ſome falſehood in the <hi>premiſſes.</hi> As in <hi>Temptation,</hi> when Satan came to Chriſt to tempt him to break his neck; the <hi>concluſion</hi> which he would perſwade him to entertain from that place in the Pſalm, was wicked, and falſe, <hi>viz. that it is lawfull for a man wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without a calling to endanger his own life;</hi> therefore he muſt needs juggle in the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> which hee doth, by leaving out <hi>[in thy ways]</hi> out of the Scripture cited: ſo in <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> if Satan delude a mans reaſon into ſuch an Aſſurance, to whom aſſurance doth not belong, there is ſome fault or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the premiſſes whence the concluſion is deduced.</p>
               <p>3. There may alſo (I conceive) be a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſurance,</hi> whoſe <hi>concluſion is true</hi> (as to the ſtate of the perſon whom it aſſures) and yet it may not be the ſpeciall Teſtimony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but meerly the Teſtimony of a mans own <hi>reaſon</hi> enlightened by ordinary il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination. For as the Spirit when he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, teſtifies with our ſpirits, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 16. So
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170084:185"/> ſometimes our ſpirits may teſtifie, when the Spirit doth not. As there may be in a man that is <hi>convinced of ſin,</hi> a true conviction by the common illumination of the Spirit, which differs widely from that ſpecial and effectual conviction which uſhers in ſaving converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So in this <hi>caſe</hi> the child of God may be let alone to frame to himſelfe a peace by arguing and reaſoning his caſe from the Word of God, and the Spirit may accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this endeavour of his by <hi>common illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> wherein the concluſion may be true, and truly inferred; nay, ſometimes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may leave a man that is truly converted, even in the buſineſſe of illumination, and ſuffer him to conclude his good eſtate irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, though truly. As (I will give you this caſe for explication) A man that hath prayed and waited long for Aſſurance, and cannot obtain it, growes weary, and can <hi>wait</hi> upon Gods pleaſure <hi>no longer;</hi> nay, I ſhall ſuppoſe, that the man may be unwilling to be aſſured without the Spirits own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ye he thinks it's long a coming, and therefore deſires to haſten it. In this caſe, the Spirit of God may juſtly let him weary himſelf in a maze of his own reaſonings for a time, and permit him to perſwade himſelfe that he is in a good condition; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becauſe though this concluſion were true, yet it was not gathered in a right way, may ſuffer him to fall into ſuch a ſin, or ſuch darkneſſe, as may make him ſee a need
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170084:185"/> of farther evidence. And in this caſe God may deal with a man as he did with Iſrael in the wilderneſſe; God had promiſed them <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they thought long ere they had it, were loath to ſtay till Gods time; and therefore whiles they think to haſten the time, they are many of them deſtroyed at <hi>Hormah,</hi> and all turned back into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">Numb. 14.</note> for forty years.</p>

                  </gap>, (a Metaphor taken from the legal purifications of the Jewes, wherein as ſoon as legal uncleanneſs was contracted, they waſhed their bodies, and their garments, and veſſels, that they might be ſure nothing they had to do withal, might defile them again) he is ever <hi>waſhing</hi> himſelf from ſin, and <hi>watching</hi> againſt it, and takes all poſſible care to keep himſelf <hi>unſpotted of this preſent world,</hi> James 1. 23. <hi>Hates the very garment ſpotted with the fleſh, Jude</hi> 23. (alluding again to the Levitical Law, in which the very cloaths of a Leper, one that had an Iſſue, a menſtruous woman, were unclean) he doth not only avoid the <hi>ſins themſelves,</hi> but the very garments of them, not only all <hi>beſmeared</hi> with the fleſh, but garments <hi>ſpotted by the fleſh.</hi> In heaven, where enjoyment is greateſt, purity is ſo too. The <hi>grace of God</hi> when it appears to us as a grace <hi>bringing ſalvation, teacheth us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world,</hi> Tit. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>It teacheth all men ſo <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> in the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170084:186"/> publication of it, (no Doctrine in the world ſuch an enemy to looſeneſſe as the Doctrine of the Goſpel) but it teacheth the Saints to do ſo powerfully and <hi>deſpoſitively,</hi> it inclines and enables them to it.</p>
               <p>(2) Regular Aſſurance in not only a <hi>heart-purifying,</hi> but an <hi>heart ſanctifying</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. Holyneſſe (in the nature of it) is the <hi>Dedication of a mans ſelf, and all that he is to the honour, glory, and ſervice of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> So <hi>God</hi> is infinitely <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe he is in all things moſt entirely and inſeparably addited to his <hi>own glory;</hi> (which (becauſe he is the moſt excellent Being,) he may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>lawfully</hi> do, but he muſt <hi>naturally</hi> and neceſſarily do) and therein conſiſts the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature: as the perfection of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being conſiſts in the end to which it is; ſo Gods perfection lies in this, that he is to himſelf, ſeeing he hath no nobler end to which his affections and actions can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: wherefore if God could deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far, as to prefer any thing elſe above himſelf for a moment, he muſt needs ſin, and ceaſe to be happy for that time, becauſe he would be ſo much removed from his end, which is his happineſſe. And of the ſame nature is holineſſe in a Saint, an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting of himſelf, and all to God, Now a Saint aſſured of Gods love, muſt needs bee holy, becauſe knowing the infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God in his own light, he cannot but conclude him the moſt worthy of all love,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170084:187"/> and ſervice, and ſo be taken up in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating and converſing with him, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, which is holineſſe; and ſo far as he at any time lets God fall low in his eye, ſo far he chargeth himſelf with unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. This we find the Saints frequently promiſe upon ſuch diſcoveries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 116. 11, 12, 13. Indeed this is that which (as it comes from us, and proceeds from the conſideration of Gods goodneſſe to us) is called <hi>thankfulneſſe;</hi> as it reſpects his own excellencies, it is called <hi>praiſing</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying</hi> him. Whence alſo take this Note by the way, <hi>The more thankful, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Thankfulneſſe and holyneſſe are the ſame things underſtood in a different concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now how large praiſes doth God get eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in the Scriptures from his people under the light of ſuch Aſſurance! How many ſuch whole Pſalmes did <hi>David</hi> pen under ſuch Diſcoveries of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance!</p>
               <p>But falſe Aſſurance, begotten by the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of Satan with our hearts, lets men more looſe from holineſſe, remits a mans love to, and zeal for God. A man that was diligent in <hi>Duties and Ordinances</hi> (the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of holineſs, in which there is a peculiar <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> of the ſoul to God) begins to grow remiſs and careleſs, he that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and plotting for Gods glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, now can ſpare the buſying of his brains
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170084:187"/> that way any more, and begins to open ſhop and ſet up for himſelf, which is a ſign that his former activity was but <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> intended meerly as a <hi>bribe</hi> to God for the light of his countenance and peace of conſcience, and therefore when that ſeems to be attained (in any how, as we ſay) God hears no more, or very little more from him.</p>
               <p>(3) <hi>Falſe</hi> Aſſurance makes <hi>careleſſe and ſecure, true</hi> Aſſurance makes <hi>watchful,</hi> and ſolicitous how to keep it. A man that hath recovered <hi>true</hi> Aſſurance, he knowes the worth of it, and how many enemies he hath that watch all opportunities to rob him of it, and he is perpetually fortiſying againſt them. Whereas to another it is not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious but that he is exceeding apt to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it upon every ſlight occaſion; <hi>Light come, and light go,</hi> we uſe to ſay. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is only to ſatisfie his conſcience, and when it hath done the preſent turn, he looks no more after it. A man will not care to manure or improve Lands to which he hath but a <hi>crackt Title.</hi> Tenderneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17, 18, 1 Pet. 2. 16</note> attends true Aſſurance; one that hath it indeed, takes no more latitude then before, he preſumes not upon it to embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him to make the moſt of his liberty which he hath by Chriſt. Falſe Aſſurance lets a man more looſe to ſuſpicious practices, it may be ſinful ones preſumingly. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19 compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>(4) Falſe Aſſurance is attended with a great
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170084:188"/> 
                  <hi>eagerneſs after the things of the preſent world.</hi> And this is the ground of dangerous Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to divers perſons, after they have been thus aſſured, the world &amp; worldly principles get an intire poſſeſſion of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the joy which they have, is not ſo ſtrong as to fortifie them againſt a time of trial, when their outward enjoyments are endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. See in the caſe of the <hi>ſtony ground, Matth.</hi> 13. 20. This is clearly affirmed in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>They ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity;</hi> great joyes and aſſurances they ſpeak of, they profeſſe the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> hath <hi>bought them,</hi> ver. 1. and 18. yet they have <hi>an heart exerciſed with covetous practiſes,</hi> ver. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170084:188"/> ſay.) Self ſeeking and covetouſneſs (let men make what pretences they will) is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a falſe profeſſion, and falſe eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſalvation. But true Aſſurance of Gods love is a mighty means of bringing the ſoul off from ſelf and the world. How libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Jacob</hi> was to his Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Nay, take my preſent, Brother, for I have</hi> [All] <hi>Heb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have told you above, that faith of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance yeelds the ſtrongeſt Arguments to contempt of the world. What need hath he to make much of a few periſhing enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is aſſured after a ſhort term of life, to enjoy an <hi>Inheritance that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</hi> What need he care for an houſe made of clay, to provide ſo much to keep it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, that hath intereſt in one <hi>without hands, eternal in the heavens?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 <hi>Falſe</hi> Aſſurance is a principle that will not bear a man out in <hi>time of trial.</hi> Thence ſo many <hi>braving ſpirits</hi> faint in a day of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20. Thus it comes to paſſe that perſons that have <hi>taſtes of the powers of the world to come,</hi> (which taſtes I conceive may include the joyes and comforts that ariſe from pretended Aſſurance) may and do fall away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Thence in times of Error ſuch perſons are quickly brought to deny the Lord, that they pretend to believe hath bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>But <hi>true</hi> Aſſurance will bear the trials of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170084:189"/> perſecutions, and falſe Doctrines. As for <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8 &amp; 1. 12.</p>
               <p>And as for the trial of <hi>falſe Doctrines,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, ſeeing Aſſurance is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truth, ſuch as truly enjoy it, will preſerve Truth as its foundation</p>
               <p>Not as if a ſoul that hath had true Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">Caution.</note> may not <hi>fall fouly</hi> in a day of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he doth not ſo contrive, plot, and lay out for wayes of eſcape as other men do; doth not invent evaſions and diſtinctions to juſtifie unjuſtifiable defections, and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. An aſſured man does his Duty, and if a croſs meet him in his way, he ſteps not out of his way to avoid it (except poſſibly the violence of a ſudden temptation make him yeeld a little to a preſent ſtorm, which infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity yet he allows not in himſelf, but quickly recovers out of it with taking ſhame and confuſion to himſelf) but is prepared (in the conſtant frame and ſtanding diſpoſition of his ſpirit) not to <hi>chuſe ſin before affliction.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> temper is ſuch a temper, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13.</p>
               <p>(6) <hi>Falſe</hi> Aſſurance makes the ſoul <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>frothy,</hi> carrys it out into <hi>notions</hi>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170084:189"/> I have ſhewed) if there be an error in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, it muſt be grounded on ſome falſhood in the <hi>premiſſes.</hi> Some Scripture miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſome heterodox opinion or other founds it; &amp; becauſe there is a chain that links errors together, and one cannot maintain it ſelf without company, rather then men will have their main copy-hold touched, or that error weakned which founds their Aſſurance, they care not in what diſputes they engage, to ſecure the main chance. This I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is the foundation of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes generally; and it were eaſie to ſhew how it comes about. Mens own falſe experiences lay the <hi>firſt ſtone</hi> in an erroneous frame, and then the Word muſt be interpreted ſo, as it wil ſute thoſe experiences (whereas men ſhould bring their experiences to the Word, and not the Word to their experiences) and then one miſ-interpretation drawes on another, and thus they multiply into vaine janglings and unneceſſary diſputes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>true</hi> Aſſurance is a <hi>ſerious, ſolid thing,</hi> &amp; brings along with it a general, experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledg of all <hi>neceſſary truth,</hi> which once learned out of the Word, it ſeals unto, and ſo it confirms a man in a practical, ſavoury ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it; whence ſuch a ſonl is full of the <hi>hidden treaſures</hi> of divine truths ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſted, and is to ſeek for nothing but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpirit from heterogeneous imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a little ſerious affective preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart to ruminate upon them, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170084:190"/> him to make a conſtant feaſt upon thoſe dainties in his own private retirements, and to communicate liberally of the ſame fare to others. Thence there is nothing more grates his ears or afflicts his ſpirit, then to have the ſtrength and fervor of his zeal drawn out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Controverſies,</hi> ſeeing he can tell how to ſpend his time, and that better.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>ſtudied Scholer,</hi> that by long ſtudy and experience hath digeſted all manner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and can upon all occaſions make profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe of it, will think his time loſt to hear a company of freſh men maintain a Diſpute about Grammatical and Logical trifles.

               <p>(7) And laſtly, <hi>True</hi> Aſſurance is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſpring of humility &amp; lowlineſs of mind, it being impoſſible that ſo intimate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, and the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſhould not reflect low thoughts upon a mans ſelf, concerning himſelf, ſuch a man cannot but ſay, <hi>Lord what am I that thou haſt brought me hitherto? what? for ſuch a peeviſh unbebelieving, impatient ſoul as mine, that have tempted thee by abundance of murmurings, and other ſinful provocations even in the wilderneſſe, and at the red ſea, to be notwithſtanding, ſo carryed in thine armes, and cheered with thy</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> How may a man know whether a <hi>true</hi> aſſurance (as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it) be gotten meerly by rational deductions, or from the Spirit of God? Wrought out of a mans <hi>brain,</hi> or wrought into his <hi>heart</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> I can but help you to gheſſe at the difference. Theſe works though they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ in themſelves, yet to appearance are very like: and therefore I ſhall ſpeak warily in a few particulars.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:170084:191"/>
               <p>1. Moſt of the former diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Teſtimony of the Spirit &amp; a falſe aſſurance from Satan and a mans own heart, may be repeated here. A <hi>true</hi> aſſurance gotten in an <hi>irregular way,</hi> wants the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a ſupernatural aſſiſtance to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and improve it; for as it was gotten in the ſtrength of reaſon, ſo it muſt act only in the ſtrength of the principle from whence it had its being; and by conſequence, can have no influence but moral and rational to the production of thoſe impreſſions of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, holineſſe, watchfulneſſe, heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, patience, ſeriouſneſſe and ſolidneſſe of ſpiritual ſelf-entertainments, humility; and ſo all theſe muſt needs be thin and ſcanty, and ſuperficial in compariſon of the ſame effects when they proceed from a <hi>divine</hi> aſſurance. Thence 'tis that you ſhal ordinarily find in the world a kind of formal, cold, thin-ſpread honeſty, juſt enough to keep life and ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as we ſay) in many perſons that are really godly, of whom a man may ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of divers of the <hi>chief</hi> men in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Gal. 2. 6. <hi>Thoſe who ſeemed to be ſomewhat in conference added nothing to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore let this be the firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. There is a mighty odds between a man <hi>divinely</hi> aſſured and <hi>rationally</hi> aſſured, in the vigour and activity of all thoſe fruits wherein it ſhews it ſelf. As you may ſee in matter of knowledge. A man that is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170084:191"/> of a Truth, teacheth it with far more life, and authority, then a man who ſees it only in a rational probable light.</p>
               <p>2. In a meer <hi>rational</hi> aſſurance there is <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do oppoſiti.</hi> As in an <hi>Opinion</hi> that a man holds meerly on probable grounds, though a man may ſtiffely adhere to it in compariſon with the contrary concluſion, yet the <hi>grounds</hi> of this confidence being but <hi>probable,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch in which he may be deceived, he is ever and anon ſubject to ſay, <hi>but what if it be not ſo all this while?</hi> And though this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion be truth, and a great many other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full concluſions as branches grow from its root, yet ſo long as hee is but probably perſwaded of it, he gives his Aſſent to it meerly with a reſerve. This is true to me, <hi>in the mind I now am in.</hi> But I may poſſibly ſee grounds to alter my judgement.</p>
               <p>Thus in point of <hi>aſſurance.</hi> Rational aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, be it never ſo full, excludes not <hi>haeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy.</hi> Thence you ſhall find when you have reaſoned with a doubting Chriſtian a long time, it may be when you go away from him, you leave him (to appearance) well ſatisfied, and pretty comfortable (as we uſe to ſay) but a while after, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his own heart have had a little time to unravel the web of your reaſonings, he begins to think he was in an errour, As an unſtable man in matters of judgment, Let an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Preacher ſpeak an houre with ſtrength of Scripture and reaſon upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170084:192"/> point, the man ſeems to be fully ſatisfied, and altogether of his mind. But this holds only till the next <hi>cunning ſeducer</hi> aſſaults him with counter-reaſons, and then the man wavers and cryes, <hi>why may not this be the truth?</hi> And ſo if <hi>twenty</hi> come one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, he ſhall ſtill ſuſpect what the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> hath ſaid, by means of the Sophiſtry of the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence a man rationally aſſured, can (to the moſt) ſay no more for himſelf then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (to allude to his expreſſion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf.</hi> I confeſſe, I cannot but incline to think bettter of my ſelf then formerly; yet <hi>am I not thereby juſtified:</hi> I dare not ſtand to the perſwaſion that I am a child of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt. I would not willingly be deceived, but I may be deceived. What if that that I take for <hi>love of God</hi> be but <hi>lelfe-love?</hi> and what if that that I take for <hi>repentance</hi> be but <hi>legal ſorrow?</hi> and what if my <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin be but a meer <hi>falling out</hi> with ſin without a total alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mind from it? It may be ſo, though at the preſent, I cannot but think it is otherwiſe with me.</p>
               <p>Now it is true (as I before ſaid) that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Aſſurance, if it proceed not from a <hi>full Teſtimony</hi> of the Spirit, excludes not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the difference between <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Aſſurance, in point of doubting, is very great. For when a man <hi>divinely</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170084:192"/> doubts, it is only ſo with him becauſe, and whiles his evidences are not full and clear. But let a <hi>rational</hi> aſſurance (that is meerly ſo) be never ſo full, yet its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt height and perfection, is thus incumbred with haeſitacines, and unreſolvedneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>In a word, he that obſerves in his own ſpirit the differences between an <hi>Opinion,</hi> and a <hi>certain Knowledge,</hi> may give (by the ſame rules of difference) a very probable gheſſe at the difference between a meerly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and <hi>divine</hi> Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>But there remains yet a third and fuller <hi>mark of diſtinction,</hi> which is,</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>way</hi> in which a <hi>rational</hi> aſſurance comes. And this may give ſome farther light to diſcover it. As for example, Judge by theſe ſix things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If aſſurance be uſhered in with an <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient wearineſſe</hi> of ſoul-troubles. This is apt to put a man upon contriving his own eſcape, and therefore may be a temptation to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of <hi>reaſoning</hi> them out of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now it is true, that the ſoul may, and ought in caſes of deſertion and diſcomfort, to put it ſelfe to the queſtion, as <hi>David</hi> doth (more then once. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. and 43.) <hi>why art thou caſt down (O my ſoul) and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoul-Troubles of Gods Saints (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance had, are moſtly ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d on <hi>phantaſy,</hi> and not <hi>reaſon;</hi> ſo that if he put that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170084:193"/> queſtion many times to himſelf, he will find he is able to give very little reaſon why he is troubled; and therefore he may lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>reaſon down reaſonleſſe Scruples</hi> (although poſſibly it may be ſafer ſometimes to <hi>caſt them off</hi> without vouchſafing them ſo much reſpect as to ſpend reaſon upon them) But in this caſe, I muſt take heed how through <hi>wearineſſe</hi> of ſtaying Gods leaſure for a releaſe, I betake my ſelfe to theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; for this is to abandon <hi>Jordan,</hi> and fly to <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharphar;</hi> to forſake the <hi>waters of Siloah becauſe they run ſoftly,</hi> and <note place="margin">Iſaiah 8, 6.</note> make not ſo much ſpeed towards us as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and labour to quench our thirſt in mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtreams of our own. This is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>break the Spirits priſon</hi> (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told you) rather then to ſtay his leaſure, til He turn the key. And when a man ſeeks his Aſſurance only from his own reaſoning, 'tis juſt with God to leave him to try it out what he can do in that way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be attended with a <hi>low eſteem of prayer, and other Ordinances of God,</hi> as thoſe which begin to appear bootleſſe and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, after ſo long trial to ſo little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Reaſon managed by prayer, and by holy pleadings with God in prayer, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means in the hand of the Spirit to work aſſurance; but it is dangerous when it comes in the ſtead of prayer. The nearer a ſoul is to a <hi>divine</hi> aſſurance, the more hee values theſe divine duties and Ordinances of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170084:193"/> Gods appointment: but when he growes ſlacker in theſe, and flyes to Reaſon, out of a diſtruſt of theſe, the more he is endangered to a <hi>rational</hi> Aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man, when he ſets upon reaſoning out his evidences, find himſelf <hi>overwilling to receive ſatisfaction,</hi> and to take every <hi>ſmal hint</hi> as ſufficient to bottom his confidence upon, is willing to think the beſt of himſelf, and ſo ready not ſo much to anſwer, as to <hi>ſilence</hi> material doubts, with <hi>general ſalvo's</hi> of the freeneſſe and fulneſſe of Gods grace, the general offers, invitations, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel (which (as I have told you) are rather foundations for relyance and hope, then Aſſurance and evidence) and apt to ſit down upon theſe, without deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to more differencing and diſtinguiſhing enquiries; this is ſuſpicious, that the peace that ariſeth thence, though it be ſutable to the eſtate of ſuch a ſoul, and ſo (he being within the Covenant) <hi>materially</hi> true, is but rational Aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="4">4 You may gueſs at it from the <hi>frame of your ſpirit under after-deſertions.</hi> A man that hath been aſſured by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is much maintained in his dependance, by a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>ſupport.</hi> I call that a <hi>reaſonleſs ſupport</hi> which keeps up a ſoul in a way of relyance and dependance when he ſees <hi>no reaſon</hi> why he ſhould do ſo; nay, it may be, ſees reaſon why he <hi>ſhould not</hi> do ſo. As it is ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in another caſe, <hi>That he believed in</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:170084:194"/> 
                  <hi>hope, againſt hope,</hi> Rom. 4. 18. that is, <hi>Faith</hi> told him there was hope that he ſhould be the <hi>Father of many Nations,</hi> when <hi>Reaſon</hi> told him there was none. So, a ſoul after Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance received from the Spirit, can appeal to his former taſtes and experiences, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi> himſelfe out of a plunge, when <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> tell him, <hi>there is no hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a meer <hi>rational</hi> Aſſurance when it is counterbalanced by reaſon as probable on the contrary ſide, affords no prop at all; but (ſayes ſuch a ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>I perceive now all my former hopes were but deluſions and dreams of golden mountains, for I am yet in the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall eaſily grant in this (as in moſt of the preceding differences) that the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the Spirits evidence, and reaſons to be gathered hence, is not alwayes certain. For poſſibly the Spirits evidence may afterwards be called to the Bar of ſuſpicious reaſoning; and a ſoul that hath had it may (by Satans Sophiſtry) be at a loſſe; but ſure a man is not ſo liable to be reaſoned out of that Aſſurance, as one whoſe <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Aſſurance was meerly rational. As a man will eaſier be baffled out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate and concluſion of his <hi>reaſon,</hi> then of his <hi>ſenſe.</hi> And the <hi>Aſſurance of faith</hi> or <hi>divine Aſſurance</hi> is ſomething in the ſoul like <hi>ſenſe</hi> in the body.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:170084:194"/>
               <p n="5">5 Ordinarily, the <hi>Aſſurance that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit gives, ſurprizeth a man unexpectedly.</hi> God therein loving to endear himſelf to his Saints, comes upon them when they look leaſt for him. I mean, as to the <hi>particular time</hi> of his coming (though they look for him indefinitely every day) he takes them at <hi>unawares.</hi> There is little of mans plotting or contrivance in the bringing it about; it may be in a Sermon that a man came <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally</hi> to, in a Prayer or Sacrament, whence (if a man might judge by the frame of his own ſpirit) he had <hi>leaſt cauſe to expect</hi> good, it may be in caſting a <hi>tranſient glancing</hi> eye upon a Scripture, without a mans <hi>pre-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> ſuch a means (at leaſt in a way of ſpecial confidence upon, or expectation from it) to ſuch an end. In <hi>rational</hi> Aſſurance a man <hi>layes</hi> the whole <hi>deſigne</hi> in his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will go medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on ſuch or ſuch a ſubject, and methodically diſcuſſe with my ſelf ſuch doubts and objections, and labour to anſwer them;</hi> and as he expects ſatisfaction from ſo doing, ſo in the cloſe he finds it, God lets him alone to <hi>hammer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out a peace upon the <hi>anvil</hi> of his owne thoughts.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Laſtly, Meer <hi>rational</hi> Aſſurance (though it may be from <hi>true,</hi> yet) oftentimes is <hi>drawn from miſtaken Scriptures.</hi> And this ariſeth from the <hi>willingneſſe</hi> before ſpoken of, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Quod volumus, facilè credimus</note> ſatisfaction, which makes a man <hi>eaſie to believe</hi> that which he <hi>would have</hi> ſo. As in
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170084:195"/> the maintaining of an opinion, it many times falls out, when a man takes up an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion firſt, and then ſeeks for Scripture to maintain it, 'tis wonderful to think, how plain he preſently is perſwaded to think, the whole Scripture ſpeaks for it: ſo here, when this is laid down before, <hi>I muſt have peace;</hi> and hereupon a man ſearcheth the Word of God, many times <hi>dark Scriptures,</hi> that another man can ſee no ſuch thing in, ſhall ſerve the turne; <hi>Prophetical Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and it may be <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> but <hi>groſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</hi> Now <hi>ſpirtual</hi> Aſſurance is uſually grounded upon Scripture rightly underſtood, (and if <hi>habitual,</hi> is certainly ſo) and the clearer the Scripture is, and the more plain the deductions from it, the better it is. For the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> underſtands Scripture per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly (as being the Enditer of it) and ſo it cannot be ſuppoſed he will ground his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony on a <hi>Miſtake.</hi> Yet we muſt not think that it is every miſtake of Scripture that is ſufficient to annul a Teſtimony; ſuch as is <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> and not of <hi>moment</hi> to caſt the concluſion this way or that way, will not weaken the Teſtimony, but only that which hath a material influence upon the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I build upon it. So a ſmal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial miſtake in a witneſſe in Court, is often overlooked by the Judge and Jury, and the Spirit himſelf often quotes the ſenſe of Scripture, and omits inconſiderable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. As in many inſtances it were eaſie
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170084:195"/> to make appear, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>Underſtand what hath been ſaid with theſe Cautions.</p>
               <p>1 Think not I condemn the <hi>matter</hi> of ſuch <note place="margin">Cautions.</note> an Aſſurance, as either hath <hi>all</hi> or <hi>moſt</hi> reaſon in it, for falſe; ſo that a man who hath reaſoned himſelf into this perſwaſion, muſt now queſtion the perſwaſion it ſelfe as falſe. For a true concluſion may be drawn from falſe and incongruous premiſſes; and it may be (as to form) in the deduction there may be no error: and a concluſion that a man receives only in a way of <hi>opinion,</hi> may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf. All that is in this caſe to be done, is to hold the ſame concluſion by the ſtrength of the Spirit drawn in by Faith in Prayer (for the Spirit may teſtifie to that <hi>ſingly</hi> (as I have before ſhewne) and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately;)</hi> and having ſo done, to improve it to all intents and purpoſes, as if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unqueſtionable. So a man may hold his land by a <hi>true Title,</hi> but his <hi>evidences</hi> for it may not be as clear as he could wiſh; now in this caſe, he will not preſently caſhier himſelf out of the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> (as ſoon as he diſcovers it) but keeping that, will labor by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or ſome other way to ſtrengthen his evidences. So when thou haſt examined thy Aſſurance by the Marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between falſe and true, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and findeſt it <hi>true,</hi> though but <hi>rational</hi> keep thy hold, and apply thy ſelf to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:170084:196"/> to ſuper-add his Teſtimony to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and improvement of it.</p>
               <p>2 Think not that I utterly exclude, the help of the Spirit in drawing a <hi>rational evidence</hi> from the Scriptures. I am ſo far from that, that I rather judge, that he helps in an <hi>ordinary</hi> way (when the deduction is proper, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that grounds it, is not in any material point miſtaken) as he doth in other works of <hi>common illumination,</hi> (as it was before hinted in the beginning of this laſt Diſcourſe) To add only a few words to the farther illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what was there affirmed. A man may be ſaid to <hi>preach or pray</hi> by the Spirit (in a general ſenſe) when he doth thoſe duties by the ſtrength of <hi>common illumination</hi> (and ſo ſometimes even godly men do,) and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he preacheth is the Doctrine of the Spirit, and the prayers he puts up, they are inſpired by the Spirit, in a way of <hi>common aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:</hi> But there is another kind of praying and preaching by the Spirit, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo often ſpeaks of and calls the <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> and the <hi>demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> performed by a ſpecial and peculiar aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">Zech. 12. 10. 1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> of the Spirit. Of which more hereafter in the handling of the laſt point. And the like twofold influence of the Spirit is there in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth acts of Aſſurance in the heart, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a godly and ſound Chriſtian. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame man may act Aſſurance ſometimes rationally, and ſometimes he may be acted to act it ſpiritually. And yet in the former the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170084:196"/> Spirit acts too in a common way; the latter only is that which becauſe of ſpecial aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is peculiarly ſaid to be the <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit.</hi> For <hi>denominatio ſequitur partem poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem</hi> (though ſometimes the denomination follow the beſt part in a thing compoſed of divers parts (as a godly man is called a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, though he have a carnal part, and that may be poſſibly moſt prevalent, yet) moſt commonly the name is given from that which is moſt in the mixture or compoſition; as we ſay an heap of barly, though there may be many grains of other grain in it; and in this ſenſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls Babes in Chriſt carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 1. So when the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in the ſpecialties of it, is rational, though there be ſome common work of the Spirit accompanying it, I call it juſtly, by way of diſtinction, a rational Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thus have I both anſwered the caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore emerging concerning a <hi>rational Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and withal, let you know, what uſe <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>may not</hi> be made of it. I add, for a cloſe, that it is well for the <hi>ſtanding peace</hi> of the Saints, when their <hi>ſpiritual evidences</hi> are <hi>rational,</hi> becauſe Aſſurance that is <hi>praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> to a man, is ſo far <hi>violent,</hi> and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>perpetual;</hi> and therefore the Saints will do well to endeavour to make even the <hi>Spirits</hi> evidence <hi>rational;</hi> and on the other ſide, it is well for the <hi>certainty and ſecurity</hi> of their evidences, that they labour to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170084:197"/> the <hi>Evidence of reaſon,</hi> into a <hi>Teſtimony of the Spirit.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. The Duty of keeping the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, preſſed with ſeveral Motives.</head>
               <p>THis alſo affords us an uſeful <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in ſeveral branches.</p>
               <p>I. Labour to <hi>keep and maintain</hi> this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence when you have it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is the <hi>ſureſt</hi> evidence of the <hi>beſt</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the world. If a man loſe <hi>all</hi> his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for an <hi>unconſiderable</hi> part of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or the <hi>weakeſt</hi> Evidences for the <hi>beſt</hi> part of his Eſtate, it troubles him not much, ſo long as he hath ſtill the <hi>firmeſt</hi> Evidences of the <hi>beſt</hi> part of his Eſtate remaining; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe he may bear the loſſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out undoing. But if theſe be loſt, he is loſttoo. You may loſe your Evidences of your <hi>earthly</hi> eſtate, and <hi>if heaven</hi> be ſure, you may not only not grieve, but even rejoyce in the loſs. But if you loſe your Evidences of heaven, you are (as to all the trueſt comfort of your lives) undone men.</p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:170084:197"/>
               <p>And yet if you loſe but ſome of theſe, and retain the <hi>main,</hi> you are in a happy condition. It may be you loſe the evidences of <hi>Grace,</hi> the ſpirit of Prayer in its ſenſible aſſiſtance, the verdure, life and activity of your ſouls in the wayes of God; nay, you loſe the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> you canot find one Promiſe in the Word of God that you dare own. Now ſtick to the <hi>Teſtimony of the Spirit,</hi> keep that and you have an Evidence ſtill in ſtead of all, and that will recover them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It may <hi>eaſily be loſt,</hi> as to the <hi>actual</hi> enjoyment of it, though the <hi>Habit</hi> cannot be loſt. The <hi>check</hi> of one holy motion <hi>may grieve the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. the <hi>commiſſion</hi> of one ſin (eſpecially by way of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and back-ſliding) may <hi>remove</hi> him. See in <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 51. 12. Luſts be cunning Theeves, and if they get into your heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the thing they moſt rob you of, is your Deeds and Evidences for glory, and then they know you are prone to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to take a portion here, ſeeing you have loſt all certain grounds of expecting a better.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Satan</hi> is alwayes at hand to <hi>deprive you</hi> (if poſſible) of the influence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit this way. He knowes what a mighty rub it is in the way of all his Temptations, that Gods people walk in the light of Gods countenance, and in the comfort of the Spirit. Therefore the greateſt and moſt
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170084:198"/> deſperate temptations of <hi>converted</hi> ſouls, tend to the hindering or weakning of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. As a cunning Adverſary in Law, layes plots, if poſſible, to weaken the validity of his Antagoniſts ſtrongeſt eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to get them into his hands, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Evidence of the Spirit loſt, will not <hi>eaſily be recovered again.</hi> It coſt <hi>David</hi> many a tear, and many an heart-pang ere he could recover him again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11, 12</p>
               <p>Satan having gotten your deeds into his hands, or made them ſuſpected in the <hi>Court of Conſcience,</hi> or it may be damned in the <hi>Starchamber</hi> of a mans own <hi>deluded heart</hi> for counterfeit; it will be an hard matter to prevail for their admiſſion ever to appear in <hi>Court</hi> again. The greater intimacy and ſecrecy of communion there hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy ſoul and the Spirit of God, the more difficulty will there be to make up a breach if it fal out between you. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Loſe that, and you <hi>loſe all the reſt.</hi> Graces will not <hi>ſhine,</hi> Duties will be cold and dull, Promiſes will <hi>ſpeak nothing,</hi> our owne ſpirits when they are called forth will <hi>bear falſe witneſſe,</hi> if the Spirit be <hi>dumb.</hi> They will all ſay as the <hi>King</hi> to the poor woman, <hi>How can we relieve thee except the Lord help thee?</hi> 2 King. 6. 27.

If the <hi>Sun</hi> hide, the <hi>Moon and Stars</hi> give none, or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſcure light.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Hamans</hi> intimate friends, when the <hi>King</hi> but frowns, are ſo far from daring to ſpeak for him, that they <hi>cover his face,</hi> and are all ready to have him away to the <hi>Gallowes:</hi> whereas on the other ſide, every grace, duty, providence, ordinance, hath ſomething to ſay for a man, when the Spirit of God is the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of the <hi>Jury;</hi> they all ſay as he ſayes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI How this may be done. And firſt concerning keeping Records of them.</head>

                  <label>Queſt.</label> BUt how ſhall I keep the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit when I have it?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſ.</label> 1. <hi>Record</hi> it carefully. That is the way for a man to ſecure an Evidence of his Lands or eſtate to ſerve him at all turns, to record the <hi>Deeds</hi> of bargain and ſale, or Donation, or whatever other way the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is ſecured, with all the formalities of Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may illuſtrate or confirme them.</p>
               <p>There be <hi>two Courts</hi> in which theſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are to be pleaded or impleaded. And therefore it will concern you to have a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate</hi> of this Evidence, that there may be a copy in each Court.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>Court of Heaven.</hi> Now it is true, that God <hi>enrols</hi> all ſuch Acts of his Spirit there; but this is but a <hi>private record</hi> (as I may ſay, with reverence) for Gods own uſe, <hi>The Lord knowes who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. This private record I cannot produce at any time, becauſe <hi>Secret things belong to God, Deut.</hi> 29. 29. But there is another way of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170084:199"/> laying up a more ſerviceable <hi>Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> which a man may have <hi>forth coming,</hi> (as we uſe to ſay) upon all occaſions; that is, by <hi>commending our Evidences to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> deſiring his own Spirit that gives them to be our <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of them in times of need. This is one of the Offices of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, not only to be the <hi>Comforter of the Saints,</hi> but their <hi>Remembrancer and Recorder</hi> too. <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. Chriſt had told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples many comfortable things in the whole preceding part of the Chapter, and now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upſhot and period of all, the great comfort with which he <hi>interlines</hi> all the reſt both in this and the following Chapters, is, <hi>I will ſend you another Comforter: And the Comforter ſhall come, whom the Father ſhall ſend in my name.</hi> But what ſhall he do when he comes? Why, he ſhall firſt be their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer,</hi> and the <hi>Promoter</hi> of their farther progreſſe in ſaving knowledg, wherein they were but Novices till Chriſts Aſcenſion; <hi>He ſhall teach you all things;</hi> and he ſhal be their <hi>Recorder</hi> or <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> he ſhall <hi>ſuggeſt,</hi> (ſo <hi>Beza</hi> renders the word, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170084:200"/> Truthes, they being part of what Chriſt had told them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Court of Conſcience.</hi> It will be needful (having once <hi>verified the evidence</hi> by the teſt of the Word) to lay it up againſt a day of tryal. Divine <hi>Truths</hi> muſt be laid up in the heart for <hi>Direction,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Experiences</hi> for <hi>Conſolation</hi> in an evil day. <hi>This Courts Recorder is Memory,</hi> and its Records in ſuch a day are of eſpecial uſe and importance. <hi>Records</hi> of Gods dealing with others formerly, ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 52. <hi>I remembred thy judgments of old, and have comforted my ſelf;</hi> i. e. <hi>Thoſe judgements by which thou haſt cauſed thy people to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their enemies in former times.</hi> So alſo of our <hi>own</hi> experiences; ſee both together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 5, 6 The holy man had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a loſſe, had it not been for this Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and yet it ſeemes he had been too to blame in the laying up his evidence, ſo that it coſt much ſearch before he could find it. <hi>I communed with my heart, and my ſpirit made diligent ſearch;</hi> the Septuagint reads, [<gap reason="foreign">

All our faith is grounded upon the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt; and the frequent reduction of thoſe grounds of faith to our conſideration muſt needs ſtrengthen it; habits of the mind are ſtrengthned by a frequent repetition of thoſe actions by which they were firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and produced. Now though gracious habits are not gotten in the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:170084:202"/> or moral powers, as natural or moral habits are; yet they are produced, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſhewed (by a ſupernatural power) in a natural method and order. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though no grounds apprehended by the underſtanding, can of themſelves beget faith, yet a divine power never produceth them, but by the repreſentation of ſome grounds. And therefore the repreſentation of the death of Chriſt, as it is held forth by God in all its benefits, to be laid hold on by me, being the ground of faith; the frequent repetition of that repreſentation, eſpecially by ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes, muſt needs feed it.

               <p>Get renewed <hi>experiences</hi> of the love of God often, by truſting him often in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes. <hi>David</hi> often doth ſo, for the conquering of ſuch or ſuch a corruption, for the reſiſting ſuch or ſuch a particular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Adventure your ſelves now and then upon the credit of particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are ſo many <hi>Specimina,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exemplifications of our intereſt in God.

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII The diſcovery of ſeveral moths that eat out a Chriſtians Evidences.</head>
               <p>3 <hi>TAke heed of ſeveral things that tend to the weakning of Aſſurance,</hi> that promote Satans malignant deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>1 Of <hi>ſpiritual pride.</hi> This is a ſin which is fed by the higheſt attainments of a Chriſtian in this life. It is thought it got into heaven in the falling Angels. 'Tis a hard matter for a poor <hi>contemptible worm</hi> to be taken up into the boſom and familiar acquaintance with God, and not to be proud of it. The proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſons in earthly Courts are thoſe, who from a mean eſtate are raiſed up to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. The ſtronger the liquor is that a man drinks, the ſooner it will flye up into his brain and intoxicate him. Temporal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions between Saints and others, find matter enough in our corrupt natures to blow up our hearts with high conceits. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then, that which makes great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, if it find an heart apt to kindle, will make the fire of pride and ſelf-conceit flame much more. But this is a dangerous ſin in ſuch a caſe. 'Tis the ready way to procure an abatement (at leaſt) if not a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170084:205"/> with-drawing of the fewel that kindles it. This is a continual <hi>ſmoak in Gods noſe,</hi> a thing that wil make him turn away his face, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 5. See a remarkable example in this caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had been taken up by a ſpecial rapture into the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> and had abundance of high revelations, and (likely enough) hee was apt to be lifted up with them in his own ſpirit. But leſt it ſhould be ſo, God graciouſly prevents the kindling of <hi>ſpiritual pride</hi> by a <hi>Meſſenger of Satan which was ſent on purpoſe to buffet him,</hi> to prevent it, and he was in ſuch a caſe, that he was faine to pray hard and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>I petitioned the Lord thrice;</hi> and yet he could not prevail for the removal of it. If God give ſuch harſh potions for the meer preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſeaſe; how bitter (think we) will he give for the healing of it? Sad <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſad <hi>falls,</hi> and ſad <hi>deſertions</hi> ordinarily attend ſpiritual pride.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) This occaſioneth the divel to be more buſie then ordinary, from a principle of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to endeavour to ſupplant you. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to tempt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> As a proud Favourite ſhall never want enemies who will endeavour to lift him out of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) This makes us <hi>neglect our walking,</hi> and whiles we build Caſtles in the air by our high conceits, we fall into many an undiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 18</note> ditch that is digged by the cunning Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our ſouls.</p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:170084:205"/>
               <p n="3">(3) Laſtly, This ſo <hi>offends God,</hi> that it provokes him to change his countenance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſoul, and endeavour the cure of the Diſeaſe by with-holding thoſe dainties which feed the humour. Nothing more provokes a Prince, then to ſee a Favourite grow inſolent upon the encouragement of his ſmiles. So God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 138. 6. <hi>He knows the proud afar off.</hi> before he brought them <hi>into the Banquetting houſe and kiſſed them, &amp;c.</hi> but now uſeth them ſlightly.</p>
               <p>3 Take heed of <hi>ſecurity.</hi> You are upon an high <hi>pinacle,</hi> and you bad need look to your ſtanding. You have a charge of <hi>precious Jewels</hi> about you, and it becomes you to have an eye in every buſh and by-lane; you have many theeves lying in wait for it. No head is more thoughtful, no perſon ſleeps leſs no mans braines work more, then a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. To ſuch a man to be ſecure and free from jealouſies, and ſuſpicions, will quickly be ruining. The ſleepineſſe of a ſouldier upon the Guard may rout an Army, more then all the aſſaults of an Adverſary, if the Guard give timely notice of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. If God <hi>ſpeak peace</hi> to thy ſoul in the aſſurance of his love, 'tis a <hi>bleſſed</hi> thing to <hi>fear alwayes,</hi> leſt thou be robbed of it. Holy <hi>Fear</hi> is the beſt <hi>Sentinel</hi> that thou canſt imploy to ſecure thy Treaſure. 'Tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing to <hi>rejoice before the Lord with trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had a bitter time of it when he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170084:206"/> was at once ſick in <hi>body,</hi> and afflicted in <hi>mind</hi> too, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. and when came this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? See <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my peace I had great bitterneſſe;</hi> it ſurprized him when he was at peace, and expected no ſuch thing. The example of <hi>David</hi> would ſeriouſly be thought upon by an heart that loves to keep acquaintance with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 6, 7. He had been when he penn'd that Pſalm, under a grievous affliction, and (whether it were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>that,</hi> or whether it grew to <hi>that,</hi> it matters not much, but) it ſeems the <hi>hiding of Gods face</hi> was a main matter in his trouble. But that I would have you obſerve. is the <hi>occaſion</hi> of this with-drawing on Gods part, which was ſo ſadly reſented on his, ſee <hi>ver,</hi> 6. <hi>In my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved:</hi> Why ſo? What <hi>ſecurity</hi> had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that made him ſo <hi>ſecure</hi> of his eſtate? why, the ſenſe of Gods extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Lord, by thy favour thou haſt made my mountaine to ſtand ſtrong;</hi> I built upon the favour of God, and thought I had ſuch a ſetled patent of it, as nothing ſhould ever bring my Title into queſtion again. But whiles <hi>David</hi> was ſecure, God begins to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his countenance, <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> v: 7.</p>
               <p>2. Beware of <hi>carnal boaſting</hi> of your <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enjoyments.</hi> This ordinarily is the <hi>breath of ſpiritual pride.</hi> I caution you againſt <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal boaſting.</hi> I know there is an <hi>holy, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> boaſting of God, which the Saints of God
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170084:206"/> are allowed and called unto, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34. 2. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 64. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 31. But this is a ſerious, grave thing, intended principally for the glorifying of God, by procuring praiſe from ſerious Chriſtians on our behalf, or for the encouraging and drawing on of others to chuſe and truſt in God upon the inducement of our experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it is mainly and principally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with a lowly and humble eſteem of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>That which I here condemn and caution you againſt, is a <hi>ſlight, vain-glorious,</hi> and <hi>uſeleſſe</hi> boaſting of ſpiritual experiences in any frothy vain company, with a deſigne to advance a mans ſelf or his party, or draw Proſelytes to his new wayes; which is very frequent in the tongues of many vaine perſons in theſe dayes. Believe it, if there were <hi>truth and reality</hi> in thoſe experiences, as they pretend, they would be more <hi>ſober<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> and <hi>modeſtly ſparing</hi> in ſpeaking of them. I am ſure the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he had been diſciplined againſt ſpiritual pride in his revelations, is ſo modeſt, that he ſpeaks of his own experiences in a <hi>third perſon, [I know a man in Chriſt that was taken into the third heaven, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 2.] he doth not ſay, it was <hi>I Paul,</hi> but leaves us to gather it was himſelf, by ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. which he lets fall by the by. A man that travels to <hi>London</hi> with a great Treaſure, will not boaſt and crack of it in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170084:207"/> where he comes, leſt he invites theeves to rob him of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed, when we conſider who <hi>made</hi> us to <hi>differ</hi> from others, and that he that made us differ, can eaſily take away that difference again, and <hi>ſhake</hi> us together into the ſame <hi>bag</hi> with others; and that there is nothing more likely to provoke him to do ſo, then ſuch a fooliſh magnifying of our ſelves, from the meere Liveries which his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gives us to wear; it were enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous ſpirits to allay all the vauntings and crackings which they may be tempted to.</p>
               <p>4 Take heed of <hi>preſumptuous ſins.</hi> Sins of <hi>infirmity</hi> and ordinary incurſion, if they grow upon us by our want of <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> are enough to provoke God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his preſence from us. But if wee adventure upon ſins of <hi>preſumption</hi> and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi> 'tis no wonder if he ſhoot our hearts full of <hi>poyſoned Arrowes,</hi> and <hi>break our bones</hi> on the rack of his heavy <hi>diſpleaſure. David</hi> adventured ſo once, but he paid dear for it, he loſt the light of Gods countenance ſo, that hee began to fear he ſhould never recover it againe. If the greateſt <hi>Favourite</hi> that is, abuſe a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces favour, and preſume upon it to bear him out in extravagant and irregular practices; 'tis the ready way (when his Maſter comes to know it) to bring him under his ſevereſt frownes. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170084:207"/> people are apt to think, that thoſe who do ſuch unjuſt things, would not dare do them, but that they have encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Power that countenances them; and ſo the miſcarriages of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> redound to the diſhonour of the <hi>Prince</hi> that imployes them.</p>
               <p>Thus, if perſons that pretend, and bear the world in hand, that they live high in the light of Gods countenance, and are ſpecial <hi>Favourites</hi> in the <hi>Court of Heaven,</hi> ſhall adventure upon ſuch practices as the wicked and profane wretches of the world do; if they ſhall lye, and ſteal, and commit Adultery, and uſe all meanes of indirect courſes to make them great, and feather their neſts in the world; the diſhonour of this reflects upon God: the world will think, that (ſure) <hi>God</hi> loves ſuch things as theſe well enough, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (for ſtate and form) he muſt ſpeak great things againſt them in his Word: Elſe why doth he lodge in his boſom, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine intimate familiarity with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as he knowes are thus notorious? And can the Lord beare this? It was hainouſly taken at <hi>Davids</hi> hands, that he had <hi>cauſed the enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. See how God complaines of ſuch <hi>Boaſters of God,</hi> that they made their <hi>boaſts of God, and the Law,</hi> and yet by the tranſgreſſing of the Law, diſhonoured God, and cauſed his
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170084:208"/> 
                  <hi>name to be evil ſpoken of,</hi> Rom. 2. 24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. God threatens ſuch a perſon that he would terrifie his conſcience to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and <hi>ſet all his ſins in order before his eies, as took his name into his mouth</hi> in a boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, and yet <hi>caſt his Law behind him.</hi> And truly (friends) I even tremble to think what a ſad time, not only in reſpect of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deſertions,</hi> and <hi>terrours of conſcience,</hi> (which I am perſwaded will eminently haunt ſuch profeſſors one day) but even in reſpect of <hi>temporal judgments,</hi> hangs over the heads of many hundreds in this Land (if not on the Land it ſelf for their ſakes) who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up their names to Chriſt, and make great boaſts of God, and ſpecial intimacy with him before the world, and yet have plunged themſelves into ſuch notoriouſly ſcandalous practices, as amaze the very Turks and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, that are any way acquainted with the ſtate of our affairs.</p>
               <p>Truly friends, (if ever God recover the credit and reputation of his <hi>Ordinances</hi> among us, eſpecially of a ſtrict and ſevere <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the Church) I look to hear of roaring conſciences good ſtore abroad in the Land: for ſurely, God muſt (if he ſpare us in temporal viſitations) have ſome way for the reparation of his honour upon ſuch perſons, as having <hi>eaten</hi> of his <hi>bread,</hi> have thus <hi>lifted up the heel againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Take heed of <hi>formality and ſpiritual</hi>

Labour to keep your ſpirits as high and vigorous in Duties, when you have <hi>attained</hi> Aſſurance, as they were when you <hi>ſought it.</hi> Let not your Devotion (as the <hi>Popiſh Mariners</hi> in the Story) fall from a <hi>candle</hi> as big as the <hi>Maſt</hi> of a ſhip, to a <hi>candle</hi> of <hi>twelves in the pound,</hi> when the Tempeſt is over. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and <hi>pay the vowes that you made in the day of your diſtreſſe.</hi> The truth is, you that could purſue ſo eagerly after God in the <hi>dark.</hi> when you were fain to <hi>grope</hi> out your way, are utterly unexcuſable if when you have the <hi>noon-day-Sun</hi> of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhining upon you, you cannot walk as freely and zealouſly in the ſtrength of communion with him. I have often told you of that of <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>The joy of the Lord</hi> is a Chriſtians <hi>ſtrength:</hi> ſure I am, it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Princes</hi> expect that their Favourites ſhould be more zealouſly at their devotion when they have advanced them, then ever they were before. Their <hi>former</hi> ſervices are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as <hi>ſtairs</hi> for their ambition to climb by; but their <hi>after</hi> ſervices are looked upon as a <hi>tribute</hi> of thankfulneſſe. 'Tis true, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Saints may, and do flag after the compleating of their Aſſurance of Gods love in ſome <hi>paſſionate heats;</hi> as the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an <hi>huſband,</hi> are not ſo wild and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous as the <hi>Suters</hi> are: but yet there is ſtill a <hi>ſteady fire</hi> burnes in faithful yoak-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170084:209"/> by which they as really endeavour mutual ſatisfaction as ever they did before, and their real impreſſions of affectionate love are conſtant, though the over eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them be allayed by mutual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All thoſe flames which <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> added before, are now extinguiſhed; but thoſe of <hi>love and good will,</hi> ſtill continue as high or higher then ever.</p>
               <p>Do not look therefore ſo much at the <hi>heat</hi> of your affections, as at the reality and ſeriouſneſſe of your expreſſions of them. But 'tis a ſad thing, when any <hi>ſlight</hi> matter is good enough for God <hi>afterwards,</hi> whereas <hi>before</hi> we thought our <hi>beſt too bad.</hi> See how God abhors this dealing. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8, 14.

               <p n="1">1) The good things of <hi>another</hi> world and <hi>this,</hi> are of a nature utterly inconſiſtent, and the pleaſures that are taken in them are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incompatible, I mean, in any <hi>eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</hi> As to be converſant among baſe <hi>Drudges,</hi> abaſeth the ſpirit of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and unfits him for taking contentment in noble and generous imployments.</p>
               <p>Certainely, the joyes of the Spirit are too ſerious, ſpiritual, and heavenly, to ſuffer themſelves to be mixed with vain, and frothy, and earthly contentments. The light of the <hi>Sun</hi> will dim and put out the blaze of a <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>candle.</hi> This <hi>Oyle of gladneſſe</hi> will not incorporate with any thing, though never ſo rich in the compoſition, which is not of the ſame nature with it ſelf; It will <hi>ſwim at the top,</hi> and if you will come at the inferiour li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, you muſt firſt skim that off.

               <p n="2">2) And when God ſees us ſo underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his favour, as to proclaime to the world, that is not ſufficient, (of it ſelfe) to fill the deſires of the ſoul (as all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>7 Beware of (that which I have often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warned you of) <hi>vain, unprofitable, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,</hi> or <hi>ungodly company.</hi> This will not only damp <hi>convictions,</hi> (I have ſhewed you ſo much before) but <hi>comfort</hi> alſo.

               <p>4. BE much in the <hi>Actings of Love and Thankfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 <hi>Love.</hi> Coolings of affection on our part towards God, God cannot bear. It were an <hi>unnatural</hi> &amp; monſtrous ingratitude <hi>at ſuch a time</hi> to flag in our love, when we are under the fulleſt and moſt enlarged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of his love to us. Then (if ever) when Gods countenance <hi>ſhines</hi> upon us, will it make our faces reflect the ſame <hi>ſmiling beams</hi> of love upon him again.</p>
               <p>Surely, ſuch enjoyments act much beneath themſelves, if they produce not a <hi>love ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then death</hi> it ſelf. If the Saints of God uſe to love God, (and 'tis their duty ſo to do) even then when he <hi>breaketh them in the place of Dragons, and covereth them with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>of death:</hi> if when he will not vouchſafe them one ſmile upon their ſouls, will not ſpeak one <hi>good word</hi> to their aking hearts, but all they ſee from him is ghaſtly frowns, and all they fear from him is chiding and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: How much more may we think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſt, they ſhould do ſo, when he
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170084:212"/> ſpreads his own <hi>banner of love</hi> over them, when he <hi>brings them into the Banquetting</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>houſe, when he layes his left hand under their heads, and his right hand embraceth them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 3. 1. 2</note> when <hi>he kiſſeth them with the kiſses of his mouth</hi> and <hi>paves</hi> all thoſe <hi>Chariots</hi> of Ordinances and Duties, wherein he conveyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and them to himſelfe, <hi>with love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <note place="margin">Cant. 3. 10.</note> therefore if at ſuch a time your love kindle not beyond the ordinary proportion, you cannot but provoke him to with-draw in diſpleaſure. See what one cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a viſiting Chriſt coſt the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>I opened to my Beloved, but my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved had with-drawne himſelf, and was gone.</hi> His love was hot in the <hi>viſit,</hi> but hers was too cold that gave him ſuch an <hi>entertainment;</hi> and therefore when ſhe opened at laſt, he <hi>was gone. v.</hi> 6. And then when the Scene was changed, and the viſit fell out to be on her part, he ſerved her in the ſame faſhion, he would not <hi>be within, She ſought him, but ſhe found him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Thankfulneſſe.</hi> I cannot imagine, if a ſoul were to <hi>wiſh</hi> a good thing on this ſide heaven, and have it, what it could deſire like ſpiritual Aſſurance of Gods love. It is as near of kin to heaven it ſelf, as poſſibly can be. It is a kind of <hi>beatifical viſion,</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the capacity of a mortal creature. And certainly the more we are admitted to the life of heaven, <hi>in happineſs,</hi> the more near
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170084:212"/> we ought to come to the life of heaven in <hi>thankfulneſs.</hi> Becauſe an <hi>heavenly</hi> life is a life of the <hi>greateſt fruit ion,</hi> therefore it is a life of <hi>greateſt thankfulneſs.</hi> To receive <hi>extraordinary</hi> mercies with an <hi>ordinary</hi> ſpirit, a ſpirit not warmed into extraordinary ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it, and thankfulneſs for it, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greateſt provocations of God the giver of them that can be.</p>
               <p>Diſcoveries of Gods love have uſed to non-plus the utmoſt abilities of a thankful heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11, 12. <hi>What ſhall I render</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> And then is thankfulneſſe greateſt, when (like the <hi>peace</hi> of God which occaſions it) it <hi>paſſeth all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Let love and thankfulneſs carry you on with <hi>delight in all the wayes of Duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> The truth is, this is the proper uſe of divine diſcoveries. Why doth the <hi>father</hi> ſmile upon, and make much of his <hi>child?</hi> is it not that he may be thereby encouraged to dutifulneſs and obedience? Why doth the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhine upon the earth, except to make it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Upon theſe termes the Church is engaged to run after Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. 3, 4. If Chriſt <hi>draw</hi> with <hi>Ointments</hi> and <hi>kiſſes,</hi> the fragrant allurements, and temptations of his love, 'tis an addition of ſtrength and agility to a poor crippled ſoul. Now if Chriſt find that you receive his <hi>favours,</hi> but reject his <hi>commands;</hi> that his <hi>countenance</hi> is delightful, and his <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:170084:213"/> welcom to you, but his <hi>Commandments</hi> troubleſom, and his <hi>yoak</hi> intolerable, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that he affords you thoſe refreſhments that they may <hi>oyl</hi> the <hi>wheeles</hi> of your ſpirits, and make them goe the more nimbly in his wayes,) Is it not juſt with him to with-draw the <hi>encouragements,</hi> and leave you notwithſtanding to your <hi>tasks of duty,</hi> to toile in the <hi>brick-kilns,</hi> and work out your very hearts in an uncomfortable <hi>drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> without the leaſt refreſhment at all to quicken your ſpirits thereunto? Theſe are the terms upon which God will manifeſt himſelf ſo to his people, as to dwel and abide with them, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21, 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words. And my Father will love him, and we will come to him.</hi> So it may be (will a ſoul ſay) but how long will he <hi>ſtay</hi> when he comes? Why? the next words ſhew, <hi>We will make our abode with him;</hi> We will dwel with him for continuance. That expreſſion of our Saviour Chriſts, ſeems a ſtrange expreſſion, <hi>When ye have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> why? <hi>Becauſe we have done but what was our duty.</hi> As if it were to be the complaint of a Saint, that he can <hi>do no more for God then he ſhould.</hi>

If a man have loſt the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his land, he will look over all his boxes and cheſts, and <hi>romage every corner</hi> (as we ſay) and will not leave, till he hath found them again. Thus (in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted) did the Holy man, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. <hi>My ſpirit made diligent ſearch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints of God in the Scripture could never ſit ſtill under ſuch a dark condition. It was <hi>death</hi> to them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 13. 3. and 143. 3, 4, 7.</p>
               <p>And no wonder; for the darkening of their evidences, is a ſuſpenſion of all influences. As during the darkneſſe of the night, or the eclipſe of the ſun by that interception of light, there is a ſuſpenſion of that quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence which the ſun hath in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. All <hi>graces</hi> will wither when God thus <hi>hides his face,</hi> all <hi>Duties</hi> will be dead, and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:170084:218"/> barren, all <hi>comforts</hi> clouded, and imbittered, as I before alſo ſhewed you.</p>
               <p>A woman that loves an husband, &amp; is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured of his affection to her, cannot endure long abſence from him. If ever you have been <hi>raviſhed with</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of God, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear his abſence long.</p>

I muſt be contented with it as it is Gods pleaſure, but I muſt not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, as it is occaſioned by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.</p>

Have I <hi>laboured</hi> in the uſe of all means to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> them?

Ordinarily, <hi>that ſinne which</hi> (upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearch of thy heart and ways) <hi>firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to the eye of conſcience,</hi> is the ſin, whether it be of <hi>omiſſion</hi> or <hi>commiſſion.</hi> God is not a little ſeen in the experiences of his people this way. The voice of <hi>conſcience</hi> is the voice of <hi>God,</hi> not only in thoſe things for which it hath a certain rule, but in thoſe things where its knowledge is but <hi>conjectural</hi> (many times) it ſpeaks by an immediate ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion from Gods holy Spirit: certainly <hi>Jacobs ſons</hi> had other ſinnes upon them, when they were in that ſtreight in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which we finde recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. but of all their other ſinnes, they are directed by the Spirit in a ſpecial manner, to their former <hi>unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cruelty</hi> towards their brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> committed about twenty years before, and they take this voice of conſcience as the voice of God, and faſten on that particular ſinne. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe come upon us.</hi> The ſoul will bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh (as dead bodies do) at the approach of that ſinne, which is guilty of occaſioning its ſpiritual trouble.</p>
               <p>2. Ordinarily alſo (though it were not ſo in the caſe of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, nor is it always ſo in the preſent caſe, with divers others, yet) I ſay, ordinarily, <hi>the ſinne that is moſt freſhly committed,</hi> before
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:170084:219"/> Gods with-drawing from the ſoul, is that which that affliction points at; and that (being laſt committed) is ordinarily alſo in the eye of Conſcience. Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the fact committed, uſeth to <hi>bluſh,</hi> and thereby betrayes its <hi>guiltineſs,</hi> if it have not, by a frequent repetition of ſins, loſt all modeſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe altogether, and contracted an <hi>whores fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> which a ſoul acquainted with God cannot eaſily do. If an <hi>Officer</hi> come in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſudden after a murther is newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, 'tis no hard matter for him to find (in a throng) who did the Fact, by the <hi>freſh circumſtances</hi> which he cannot eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look. So (though all other ſins have an hand in this fact, yet) a man ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerve in the ſins newly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſome <hi>tokens</hi> and <hi>indications</hi> more then ordinary, which may provoke the ſoul immediately to lay hold upon them in an eſpecial manner, and indict them for the Fact.</p>
               <p>(3) Examine <hi>what ſin thou didſt</hi> (when (as yet) thou didſt walk in the light of Gods countenance) <hi>moſt fear and ſuſpect, as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wait for the life of thy Aſſurance.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Saints obſerve in themſelves ſome one <hi>conſtitution-ſin,</hi> or other <hi>darling</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which at all times they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt inclined to, and that ſin (if they manage their comforts as they ought) they ſet a ſpecial <hi>guard</hi> upon, as ſuſpecting it more
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170084:220"/> then ordinary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. Now if it chance at any time that this guard be ſlackned, it is ten to one if a <hi>backſliding into that ſin</hi> do not murther their ſpiritual peace. And if ſo, 'tis no hard matter to find it <hi>guilty of the fact</hi> by ſtrong circumſtances and probabilities, if not by certain and convincing Evidences; becauſe God puts a <hi>ſpecial Mark</hi> upon ſuch ſins, as enemies to the peace of his Saints. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. <hi>God will ſpeak peace to his people, but</hi> (then) <hi>let them not turn again to folly;</hi> let them take heed of Apoſtatizing and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back to their former maſter ſins; <hi>q. d.</hi> if they do, they will quickly loſe their peace againe. <hi>I kept my ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) from mine iniquity,</hi> that ſin which I was peculiarly prone to.</p>
               <p>Now this is a good rational and probable ground of proceeding againſt ſuch a ſin, that there are ſuch ſuſpicious againſt it. If a <hi>murther</hi> be ſecretly committed, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Fact not preſently apparent, yet if from certain evidence it can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that ſuch a perſon <hi>threatned</hi> him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and <hi>laid in wait</hi> to take away his life formerly, and the murthered party had a conſtant <hi>jealouſie of him,</hi> it is as great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as circumſtances can make, that ſuch a perſon did the fact; and therefore the Judge will examine ſuch a perſon narrowly, <hi>where he was</hi> when the Fact was committed; and if he cannot give a probable account of his diſtance from the place at that time, 'twil
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170084:220"/> go hard with him. Now take thou the ſame courſe: Some <hi>ſin</hi> or other hath taken away the <hi>life of thy ſoul,</hi> which is the comfortable preſence of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 30. 5. If thou canſt not find the murthering ſin preſently, and upon the place; then examine that ſin which hath often <hi>threatned</hi> it, and hath <hi>watched</hi> frequent opportunities to do it, and enquire whether that ſin were ſo far from thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of Gods departure, as may excuſe it from the ſuſpicion of the Fact: and if not, but that thou haſt (at leaſt in thy heart) near that time, taken acquaintance with it again, there needs no farther evidence. Take it and <hi>crucifie it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4) Poſſibly it may be a <hi>ſin of ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion,</hi> which thou haſt been moſt <hi>ſecure</hi> of, and madeſt (ordinarily) the <hi>leaſt account</hi> of, when thou haſt at any time fallen into it. Sometimes, whiles a Saint watcheth diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the incurſions of <hi>greater</hi> ſins, or ſuch as are more <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> to him, ſome ſin that he makes little account of, lyes <hi>lurking</hi> in the throng to do him a miſchief, like the <hi>Adden in the path</hi> (as <hi>Dan</hi> is deſcribed) <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 19. <hi>biting the horſe heels, ſo that the Rider falleth backward.</hi> Now the truth is, no ſin is <hi>ſmal in it ſelf,</hi> and a ſmal ſin (in compariſon) <hi>frequently admitted,</hi> either by wilfulneſſe or ſecurity, may (like a little thief) as well ſteal away ſuch a Jewel as thy ſpiritual Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is, as a greater; nay, becauſe thou thinkeſt it <hi>ſmal,</hi> it thereby becomes <hi>great</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:170084:221"/> by cuſtomary commiſſion. It may be thou haſt not repented for it in particular (though often fallen into) as thou haſt of others; and that hath made thee ſo eaſie to admit it again into thy heart of late, that now it is growne a familiar ſin, and thou beginneſt to <hi>regard it in thy heart.</hi> It need not amaze thee, if (in this caſe) God withdraw the light of his countenance from thee; and that <hi>ſmal</hi> ſin may do thee that miſchief, which a <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (of which thou art more jealous) cannot.

               <p>3 IF you find that you loſt it by ſuch or ſuch a miſcarriage of your own, you muſt ſpeedily labour by proceeding in an holy ſeverity againſt the Malefactor, to turn away wrath from you. The longer thou delayeſt, the harder it will be to recover the clear ſight of thy evidences when thou haſt
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:170084:221"/> ſuffered them to lye long under the dirt and duſt of ſuch ſinful pollutions. Take this courſe then.</p>
               <p>1) <hi>Lament and bewaile</hi> both your <hi>loſſe,</hi> and the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it. When ſin provokes God to hide his face, there is a <hi>double</hi> cauſe of mourning. If a man could (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin) enjoy the ſmiles of Gods face, yet it is the duty of Gods Saints to mourn for <hi>ſin;</hi> and certainly the Saints never mourne more kindly then when the <hi>warm beams</hi> of Gods love <hi>diſtil the ſoul into tears</hi> (as they will do, and that upon this account, that it is a thing directly contrary to Gods holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Law, and therefore diſpleaſing to him, though he do not alwayes teſtifie his diſpleaſure againſt it.) But <hi>now,</hi> when to this ſhall be added the actual <hi>manifestation</hi> of his high <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> in the turning away of his face from the ſouls of his dear Saints for its ſake; here certainly, their ſorrow hath a <hi>double occaſion,</hi> and they are inexcuſable, if they ſhall (in this caſe) <hi>rejoice as other people, Hoſ.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
               <p>Thoſe perſons are <hi>vain talkers</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10.) who deny the Saints of God the exerciſe of ſo neceſſary an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as godly ſorrow in ſuch a condition, which is (in effect) to expoſe them to a continual darkneſs &amp; uncomfortableneſs under the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, ſeeing God hath profeſſed, that he will with-draw till men <hi>acknowledge their offence,</hi> Hoſ. 5. 15. and hath annexed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:170084:222"/> to a <hi>mourning condition, Mat.</hi> 5. 4. and promiſed to <hi>dwell with the contrite ſpirit, and to revive their hearts, Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. and 61. 2. and <hi>anointed his ſonne with the oyl of gladneſſe,</hi> in eſpecial manner, for the ſakes of <hi>them that mourn in Zion,</hi> and eſpecially confines his <hi>healing</hi> grace to <hi>brokenneſſe of heart, Iſai.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. putting ſo honourable a name upon it, as to own it for his <hi>chiefeſt, and moſt acceptable ſacrifices, yea to account it in ſtead of all other ſacrifices.</hi> For ſo the expreſſion imports, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. Friends, will you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of your temporal evidences, and vex at your own folly in miſlaying them, or parting with them? and can you ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear the loſſe of eternal ones?</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>Repent, and do your firſt works.</hi> Except <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 5.</note> the <hi>cauſe</hi> be removed, the <hi>effect</hi> will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. Till the ſinne be removed for which God hath withdrawn himſelf, God will not returne. He that avoyds a place, becauſe of the <hi>infectious ayre,</hi> or any other <hi>inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> in his habitation there, will not (in reaſon) returne, till the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val be <hi>removed.</hi> If thou wilt have Gods face <hi>towards thee</hi> as at former times, thou muſt ſet thy face <hi>towards him</hi> as at former times. I have formerly enlarged upon that remarkable place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20. Where as ſoon as <hi>Ephraims heart turnes,</hi> Gods <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> are <hi>turned</hi> too. <hi>Is Ephraim a pleaſant child? &amp;c. therefore my bowells are troubled for him, &amp;c.</hi> It is no boot for men to bewail
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:170084:222"/> their loſſe, except they remove the ſinne that cauſeth it. God may ſay in this caſe as he did to <hi>Joſhua, Why lyeſt thou upon thy face? Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>hath ſinned, and I will be with you no more, except you deſtroy the accurſed from among you.</hi> So he may ſay to thee, why <hi>doſt thou lye whining at my feet? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and deſtroy the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, take away the ſinne that makes me leave my habitation, and I will return again: but till then I will not be drawn to rteurne by all thy prayers and tears.</hi> Mourning <hi>for ſinne,</hi> pleaſeth God no farther then it turns us <hi>from ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) This and ſome other ſpecial duties, which may tend to Gods ſpecial glory, you may bind your ſelves to by vowes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 13.</p>
               <p>4. But if you cannot finde any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in your ſelves (as to <hi>matter of ſinne)</hi> which may move God to withdraw, and the Spirit to detain from you the clear ſight of your evidences; it will yet be good to <hi>wait upon God in all duties of Religion with double diligence at ſuch a time,</hi> and to <hi>labour</hi> at adventure (in the exerciſe of thoſe duties) <hi>to affect your hearts with the farther ſenſe of your inclination to thoſe ſinnes which are more peculiarly hinted out to you before, as eſpecially active in procuring all ſuch ſad days to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God;</hi> to <hi>waite patiently</hi> upon God without thoſe uſual diſtempers of ſpirit, which oftentimes the people of God prolong their troubles by during this time of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:170084:223"/>
               <p>5. <hi>Labour</hi> as much as poſſibly you can, <hi>to grow in ſelfe-abaſing humility,</hi> and an <hi>high prizing and pretious eſteem of Gods preſence,</hi> that thou maiſt thereby anſwer Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in his preſent cloudy walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, ſeeing perhaps he withdrawes his witneſſing ſpirit, meerely by way of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> as oft times he doth. God may fore-ſee the inclination of thy heart to <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride,</hi> which thou doſt not ſee. God may foreſee that too much <hi>familiarity</hi> with him, may be apt to be anſwered with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> on thy part; and if ſo, he may in pity and prudence withdraw the matter of ſuch a temptation before hand, as a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> keeps that body low in fleſh, which he ſees inclined to evil humours, though it be not actually diſtempered by them. Now if thou cooperate with God in this deſigne (as poſſibly it may be this, he aimes at) ſurely thou wilt haſten thy deliverance from thy preſent darkneſs.</p>
               <p>6. Labour to <hi>live by faith in the mean time.</hi> For (as I told you before in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the getting of Aſſurance, ſo) I tell you now in the way of recovering loſt Aſſurance, the main work is to exerciſe an <hi>holy reliance</hi> upon God, in a condition ſo ſad and uncomfortable as this muſt needs be. This we find hath been the practice of the Saints of God in the like caſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 13. <hi>David</hi> had been in a great ſtraight, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of his <hi>Excluſion from Ordinances,</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:170084:223"/> but even in the <hi>ſad concluſions</hi> which he drew thence, to the diſtempering of his ſpirit. See how he cloſeth all; <hi>I had fainted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>except I had believed to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the Land of the living. Job</hi> ſpeaks bigger words, <hi>Though hee kill me, I will truſt in him. Job</hi> 13. 15. <hi>q. d.</hi> Satan tels me, (and my own miſgiving <hi>heart</hi> many times ſeconds him) that theſe troubles will make an end of me, I ſhall never come alive out of them. Well (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> be it ſo, <hi>lot him kill me if he will; if I were now a dying, and dropping into Hell, yet I will hold faſt for all that: he ſhall not be rid of me ſo. If I goe to hel, I'll pul him after.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> alſo in his Agony, cryes, <hi>My God,</hi> though he were a <hi>forſaking God.</hi> This is a ſweet frame of Spirit, when God ſeemes to hold <hi>looſe,</hi> and man holds the <hi>faſter</hi> for it; God <hi>ſpurns at</hi> a poor ſoule, and he <hi>layes hold of his foot;</hi> God ſayes, <hi>Jacob, let me goe;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>no, I will not let thee goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except thou bleſs me. Gen.</hi> 32. 26. The advice is plaine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. I urged this place before in the <hi>directions</hi> for <hi>procuring</hi> Aſſurance, and there told you that there is a parity of caſes, and ſo a proportion in the means which are to be uſed for recovery, in the ſoule that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had,</hi> and the ſoule that <hi>hath loſt</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>This muſt needs be a ſpecial way: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This frame of Spirit ſpeaks <hi>ſtrength of faith.</hi> A ſmall ſtrength will ſerve to hold
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170084:224"/> one that is <hi>willing to ſtay,</hi> but when a ſtrong man putteth out all his ſtrength to wreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of a friends importunate embraces, it had need be more ſtrength then ordinary that holds him, or fetcheth him back then. This is that by which the ſtrength of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith is diſcovered (in another caſe:) <hi>he was</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſtrong in faith,</hi> [he was <hi>mightily enabled</hi> by faith] what to <note place="margin">

And thus it is in thee, it is an evidence of ſtrong faith, when thou canſt ſay, <hi>let my heart tell me never ſo much, God hath caſt me off, and there is no help for me in God; yet I will not let goe my confidence, and the hold that thereby I have upon him;</hi> here is ſtrong faith. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 24, 25, 26. The womans faith was admired by Chriſt upon this account, that ſhe would <hi>play the dogg,</hi> and fall at his feet, when he rated her away. <hi>O woman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>great is thy Faith.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are apt to think that <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Gods love, when a ſoule walks in the clear light of Gods countenance, and lives high thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a <hi>ſtrong faith.</hi> But, I tell thee friend, there is <hi>more ſtrength</hi> by far in that faith that <hi>depends upon God in darkneſſe and deſertion,</hi> that truſts when a man can ſee no light. The truth is, the life of Aſſurance is (in a ſort) a life of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> and it is rather a life <hi>above faith,</hi> a life of <hi>enjoyment.</hi> Faith is the <hi>evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> ſaith the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:170084:224"/> to the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 1. Aſſurance (in proper ſpeech) is the <hi>firſt fruits of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and it's life is a life of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>fruition,</hi> not of <hi>faith.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith of hope, in this Chapter, <hi>Hope that is ſeen, is not hope, ver.</hi> 24. So ſay I of faith; <hi>faith that is ſeen, is not faith.</hi> Faith is a friend made eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for a <hi>time of diſtance</hi> between the ſoul and its comforts; and is appointed as a meanes to derive the benefit of them to the ſoul, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſtate of diſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Beſides, 'tis no wonder if God be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the actings of faith in ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing ſtrength of faith <hi>gives glory to God. Rom.</hi> 4. 20. And he cannot long withdraw from a ſoul that ſo much glorifies him upon ſo little encouragement. I may ſay to thee as Chriſt to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Hold this courſe and thou art a bleſſed man. <hi>Others ſee, and believe. But bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet believe. Joh.</hi> 20. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides, (laſtly) this frame of ſpirit <hi>muſt needs keep down many of thoſe murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, deſpairing, and</hi> (in a ſort) <hi>blaſphemous miſapprehenſions concerning God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which length of ſoul-troubles is apt to plunge a man into.</hi> And certainly, the leſſe <hi>iniquity</hi> there is breaking forth in our <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the ſooner they will be over. Now faith, in ſuch a ſeaſon, maintaines <hi>good thoughts</hi> of God, and <hi>defends</hi> him, and <hi>takes his part</hi> againſt the calumnies of Satan. And
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:170084:225"/> God that ſees and knows this, (therefore) how can he but take this kindly? If an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band abſent himſelfe a while from a wife, and ſhe be ready, upon every whiſper of ſlanderous goſſips, to ſuſpect her husbands fidelity in his abſence, and give out ſpeeches tending that way, can it be expected that any husband ſhould take pleaſure in ſuch a wife? Wil he not rather chuſe to ſtay away ſtil, and be ſuſpected for <hi>ſomthing</hi> (as we ſay) rather then live under conſtant ſuſpicions for <hi>no cauſe?</hi> But when the heart of an husband may be ſecure of this, that his wife is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his faithfulneſſe, and her heart qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly reſts in him, <hi>abſent</hi> as well as <hi>preſent,</hi> let ſuſpicion ſuggeſt what it will, ſurely, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be exceeding tender of ſuch a wife, and much taken with her company. God ſees your jealouſies of him in darkneſſe, and obſerves how apt you are to cenſure him in his abſence. Doe not thinke this is the way to bring him back againe. He will make you entertain better thoughts of him, ere he returne.</p>

               <p>And (let me adde once more that) there are Promiſes even in this thing, which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we muſt interpret with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned limitations, yet) may be great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to us to <hi>ask in faith,</hi> and grounds upon which we may comfort our ſelves even in the preſent exigency with ſome intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an hope of releaſe. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 16. is an excellent place, and hath relation to <hi>this life,</hi> becauſe of the reaſon that is annexed, <hi>I wil not contend for ever, lest the ſpirit ſhould fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But (however) ſuppoſe thou have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground to believe a returne of comfort here; yet believe that thou ſhalt ſee his face in glory hereafter, and that no <hi>troubles ſhall be able to ſeparate from Gods love,</hi> though they may from the <hi>ſenſe of his love,</hi> Rom. 8. 35, 38, 39. And eternity of enjoyment is a duration
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:170084:227"/> large enough to make up the want of God here.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Believe, that <hi>the likeliest time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoyment of his countenance, is, when thou art moſt in danger of being ſwallowed up of deſpair.</hi> And truly; when the violence of temptation doth moſt <hi>importunately</hi> put the ſoul upon deſperate thoughts, againſt all the ſtrength of Meditation, prayer, reſolutions to the contrary, then is deliverance at hand. <hi>Cum duplicantur lateres, venit Moſes,</hi> ſay the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins; <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Deliverer, <hi>comes when the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>bricks are doubled.</hi> Mans <hi>extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> fits God with the beſt <hi>opportunity,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own glory in his deliverance. <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen,</hi> Gen. 22. 14.</p>

Are there no encouragements given to perſons that want a preſent intereſt in God? How comes any (then) to get an intereſt in God? Is
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:170084:228"/> it not by laying hold on him under ſome Scripture encouragement? The abſolute promiſes (as we uſually call them) of the firſt grace and acceptance in Chriſt, belong to any that can lay hold of them. Friend, begin again, and lay hold upon ſuch Promiſes as thou didſt at firſt faſten upon, and do not let them go. And never diſpute whether thou haſt an intereſt or no: But if thou think thou haſt not, labour to get an Intereſt by <hi>laying hold</hi> on them.

               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>explaination</hi> of this point, know that this Doctrine holds true of <hi>all the works</hi> of the Spirit of Adoption mentioned in the firſt Theſisof this part.

               <pb n="443" facs="tcp:170084:230"/>
               <p>But I ſhall handle this principally in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>witneſſing work</hi> of the Spirit, which hath hitherto been drawn through the whole web of this diſcourſe. Only (in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) I muſt give this ſhort hint for the ſakes of thoſe who elſe might occaſion ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves hereby, as conceiving themſelves excluded from the comfort of the Doctrine, becauſe (though they have <hi>other</hi> works of the Spirit that <hi>accompany ſalvation,</hi> yet) they have not had experience of <hi>this aſſuring act.</hi> For their ſakes therefore, let it ſuffice once for all to tell them, that if the Spirit of God have wrought in them any work that <hi>accompanies ſalvation,</hi> all that which ſhall hereafter be ſaid concerning the priviledge of <hi>Aſſured ſouls,</hi> is no leſs proper to them. <note place="margin">

               </p>

                  <hi>troubles of conſcience again.</hi> I told you upon the laſt Doctrine that a Saint may loſe the actual Aſſurance of Gods love; and there is nothing more frequent in Scripture then the ſad complaints of precious people of God, under ſuch darkneſſe. The Lord to take off all ground of expecting ſuch an exemption from his people, was pleaſed to hide his face from his own <hi>natural ſonne,</hi> and to withdraw from him the ſenſible comfort of his divine nature, upon the croſſe, and (before that) left him to grievous <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from Satan himſelfe. True there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>our Saviours</hi> caſe &amp; <hi>thine;</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> under his deſertion, was under part of that <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory puniſhment</hi> which Gods juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him for ſinne. <hi>Thy after trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> are not of <hi>that nature.</hi> But herein the parallel holds; that height of <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God, and height of <hi>communion</hi> with God are no ſufficient ſecurity to a ſoul of never loſing the ſenſe and comfort of them. A priſoner many times may be detained, even by the keeper, after the Judge acquits him, till hee <hi>pay his fees.</hi> And it may be the holieſt man may be <hi>unthankfull,</hi> and ſo be clapt up again in the houſe of Bondage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the deareſt Saints of God, after Aſſurance, <hi>may fall</hi> not only into <hi>trouble of ſpirit</hi> again; but into <hi>bondage of ſpirit</hi> alſo. They may fall ſo low out of the aſſurance of Gods love, that they may conclude

I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>David</hi> after his great falls was under as great fears of Hell, as ever he was in his firſt converſion.

A man whom the Judge and Jury acquits at the Aſſiſe, may bee arreſted at anothers ſuit, and layd up again. And ſo may a child of God after a diſcharge from the <hi>ſuit of conſcience</hi> in his firſt converſion, bee arreſted again, and as much fear the Law as ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay (poſſibly) <hi>his after-terrors may be greater and longer then the former.</hi> Hee may have a far <hi>more hideous dungeon</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>

               <p>For it may be,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>God intended</hi> (providentially) ſuch a condition to him <hi>before,</hi> but ſaw his <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> at the <hi>first converſion</hi> for the under-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo heavy a burthen, and therefore (in pity) forbare that rigor <hi>then,</hi> til by the warme influence of ſome glances of love from his countenance, he had <hi>fitted</hi> him with a <hi>proportion of ſtrength</hi> to glorifie him in <hi>greater trials.</hi> In <hi>meaſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when it ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, will he debate with it.

               <p>For <hi>Scripture.</hi> Take notice of the names by which the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſet out to us in the Word.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) He is called <hi>the Comforter,</hi> John 14. 16. And this in his <hi>peculiar</hi> Office to the Saints. Now he would fail in the diſcharge
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:170084:234"/> of it, if ever he ſhould bring Gods adopted children into bondage againe. Therefore when our Saviour promiſeth the Comforter, he alſo engageth that he ſhall <hi>abide with</hi> the Saints, <hi>John</hi> 14 16. 'Tis true, their <hi>comforts</hi> are many times <hi>fleeting</hi> comforts; But the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is not to be blamed for that. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily 'tis their <hi>own fault,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>Satans temptations</hi> eclipſe the comforts and refreſhments of the Spirit to the ſoule: Though their comforts be fleeting, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is not. To debaſe himſelf from being the Comforter, to the Divels imployment, the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> is diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Beſides, he is called our <hi>Seal:</hi> and how long doth he continue ſo? <hi>unto the day of redemption,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. Hee will not <hi>to day</hi> ſcale an <hi>evidence of heaven</hi> to the ſoul, and <hi>tomorrow</hi> ſeal its <hi>Mittimus to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Moreover, he is called our <hi>Earneſt:</hi> and can we think that God will give us an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of heaven <hi>one day,</hi> and revoke it again <hi>the next;</hi> or ever deny the <hi>bargain</hi> which that Earneſt ſecures unto us? An <hi>honeſt man</hi> will not do ſo; far be it from God to do what common honeſty will keep man from. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He is the <hi>Spirit of Adoption, teſtifying to us that we are the children of God,</hi> ver. 16. of the chapter in hand. And can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that he will ever tell a <hi>child of God,</hi> that he is become <hi>a child of the Divel?</hi>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. (I have ſhewed before, that) The <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> never croſſe each others Teſtimony. Now the <hi>Word</hi> never pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth bondage to any one that hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Witneſſe of the Spirit;</hi> nay, not to any one that hath the leaſt <hi>grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> The Word every where ſpeaks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſuch: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 34.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. That which is the <hi>badge of a falſe Prophet,</hi> and which God diſlikes in ſuch. cannot, without blaſphemy, be attributed to the holy Spirit of God: But to <hi>make the heart of the righteous ſad,</hi> is a badge and ſin of falſe Prophets, <hi>Ezek</hi> 13. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. That ought not to be ſuppoſed to be wrought by <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, which (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is on <hi>our</hi> ſpirits) is our <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:</hi> but to <hi>doubt</hi> of the ſaving love of God, after enjoyment of the manifeſtation and feeling of it, is our ſin and <hi>infirmity, Pſal.</hi> 77. 20. And therefore the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Author thereof: becauſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit cannot be the Author of <hi>ſin.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. That which hinders the moſt <hi>proper and peculiar work of the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi> cannot be the work of the Spirit (except we ſuppoſe the Spirit ſo indiſcreet, as to counteract himſelf.) But if the Holy Spirit ever become a Spirit of bondage to the ſoule after taſtes of Gods love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thereunto, the Spirit would be guilty of counter-acting its moſt proper and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:170084:235"/> peculiar work; which (as the next Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the laſt words of the Text ſhews you) is to <hi>embolden and enliven the heart in Prayer.</hi> For how can he <hi>call God Father</hi> with confidence, to whom the Spirit witneſſeth that God is an <hi>enemy?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. The Spirits Teſtimony (if it could ever become a Spirit of Bondage againe to an aſſured ſoul) <hi>would not be a ſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teſtimony,</hi> contrary to the truth of the preceding Doctrine. When a man is found in two contrary tales, we know not which of them we may believe. A man could never, (this ſuppoſed) have ſolid comfort from the Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeeing he knowes not how ſoon hee may recant it, and teſtifie the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> The main and principal cauſe is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> who <hi>combining with our own ſuſpitious, and diſtruſtful, or melancholy ſpirits, or by divine permiſsion, or</hi> (laſtly) <hi>by taking the work of Gods Spirit out of his hand,</hi> brings us into this darkneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 3. <hi>The enemy hath perſecuted my ſoul, he hath made me to dwell in darkneſſe like thoſe that have been long dead.</hi> I have long ago buried all my comforts, and they are almoſt quite out of remembrance. And the great cauſe of all this is the <hi>enemy</hi> of my ſoul; called <hi>[the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my]</hi> by a ſpecial Emphaſis, becauſe the moſt deadly malicious enemy the Saints have. He <hi>ſowes</hi> all manner of <hi>Tares</hi> of corruptions, tentations, doubts in <hi>Gods field,</hi> the hearts of Saints. Now this he doth (as but now I hinted)</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Partly, by <hi>combining with our owne ſuſpicious hearts,</hi> and increaſing jealouſies when there is no cauſe of ſadneſſe, as many times he doth. The heart that knowes its own wickedneſſe and deceitfulneſſe, many times rejects <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>ſolid joy</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt as a <hi>deluſion,</hi> meerly upon <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> and <hi>warineſſe,</hi> occaſioned by its former experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced liableneſſe to <hi>ſelf-deception.</hi> Now here <hi>Satan</hi> ſtrikes in, and increaſeth the <hi>jealouſie</hi> that the heart hath of it ſelf. As a <hi>malicious tale-bearer,</hi> that finds ſuſpicions ready to break out ever and anon between friends, is at hand perpetually to blow the coals, and hinting to them both ſeverally, ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170084:236"/> preſumptions of each other, till at laſt he have weakned all mutual confidence, and made an irreparable breach between them. <hi>Fie, fie,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>old Serpent) wilt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe comforts and joyes are real, and from the Holy Ghoſt?

Dost thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how it ſpake peace to thee heretofore, and all the Miniſters in the Countrey could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee that thy condition was not ſafe then? and ſince, doſt thou not remember how when thou wenteſt to examine and ſearch thy ſelf, it hid ſins by pretences, and excuſes, and Apologies? And why ſhould it not deceive thee now, as well as then?</hi> Now here, many times the ſoul gives up, and yeilds to Satans ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and damns all its <hi>comforts</hi> for meer <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies</hi> and <hi>dreams,</hi> and all its <hi>Aſſurance</hi> for an <hi>imposture.</hi> Nay, it may be, if the ſoul plead the <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> of the Spirits concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in that Teſtimony, then Satan begins to take the matter upon himſelfe. <hi>Alas,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and doſt thou not know that Satan can turne himſelf into an Angel of Light, and by</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Partly, by <hi>combining with a meer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy diſtemper.</hi> Melancholy is muſing
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:170084:237"/> and thoughtful. 'Tis a <hi>temper of body</hi> which is the <hi>Divels Anvil,</hi> whereon he <hi>hammereth</hi> all manner of <hi>temptations,</hi> all manner of <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapons</hi> to wound the ſoul.

And to ſtrengthen the belief of the ſoul in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, he can preſent ſtrange <hi>ſpectra,</hi> images and repreſentations of terrour to the very outward ſenſes, by which ſuch inward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions

               <p n="3">3 To admit of <hi>lawful avocations from the continued meditation of ſuch ſubjects, as by their fixing on the fantaſie are hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi> The very humor of <hi>melancholy</hi> is a <hi>dull, heavy</hi> humour, that muſt be ſtirred as much by <hi>exerciſe</hi> as <hi>Phyſick.</hi> And ſo muſt the fantaſies that it begets be cured by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</p>
               <p>(3) Partly, by the <hi>permiſſion and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God,</hi> (God giving the ſoul over in ſome caſes into his hands (as he did <hi>Job</hi> once) to do with him what he will, <hi>only ſparing his</hi>

And in ſuch a caſe <hi>(God</hi> withdrawing) it is no hard matter for <hi>Satan</hi> to improve ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible defect and decay of influence, to infer a ſouls utter rejection by God. The truth is,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:170084:238"/> we live much by <hi>ſenſe</hi> as well as <hi>fantaſie,</hi> not only in <hi>humane</hi> affairs but even in <hi>Divine.</hi> And when <hi>faith</hi> is at low water (as ordinarily it is upon Gods with-drawings) then is <hi>ſenſe</hi> moſt predominant. Now the Divel can make ſtrange concluſions appear undeniable in ſuch caſes, if you will allow him to argue from what you <hi>feel. Doſt not perceive</hi> (will he ſay to the ſoul) <hi>that God caſts out all thy prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not the voice of thy groanings, how he will not be perſwaded to give thee one ſmile, though thou wooe him never ſo much? And wilt thou (contrary to all ſenſe and experience) ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he loves thee? Did he ever cruſh any ſoul under his feet, that he did not kick into hel at laſt?</hi> And no wonder if <hi>Satan</hi> when hee hath the command of all the Ports and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the ſoul, wil let it receive no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence but what he pleaſeth, and uſe it to ſuch daily objects as augment its Terrors, if he raiſe ſuch <hi>miſts</hi> as hinder it from diſcerning any thing diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>(4) Partly, by <hi>taking the work out of the Spirits hand,</hi> as ſometimes he doth (the Lord permitting it alſo for ſecret Reaſons of his own.)</p>
               <p>And hereof I ſhal ſhew you ſome inſtances by which you may judg of his dealing in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Many times the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſtirrs up the ſoul to <hi>examine its growth in, and improvement of grace</hi> (poſſibly upon occaſion of ſome late notable delays) and to endeavour a recovery
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:170084:238"/> of loſt ſtrength, a <hi>quickning of what is ready to dye.</hi> This motion being from the Spirit <hi>thus far;</hi> now Satan takes it up, and from felt barrenneſſe and deadneſſe, ſtirs up the ſoul farther to enquire afreſh whether ever that were true grace that is now ſo barren; whether ſuch a <hi>tree</hi> had ever any <hi>life,</hi> that manifeſts ſo little <hi>growth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Many times the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſets home the <hi>conſideration of ſome affliction,</hi> and puts the ſoul upon enquiry <hi>why</hi> the Lord thus <hi>contends with it.</hi> Now comes in Satan and alters the Queſtion, and puts the ſoul upon the enquiry, <hi>Whether ſuch afflictions may ſtand with Gods love or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Many times the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſtirs up to <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and <hi>recovery from grievous falls. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> takes up this work, and puts the ſoul upon queſtioning, whether ever it had any grace, ſeeing there is yet in the heart a lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to ſuch great corruptions? This I touched before.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee whence the terrors that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize Saints after converſion and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance do ariſe; and ſo the Theſis cleared from miſtakes. Proceed we now to the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. The way how to diſcard them.</head>
               <p>THis alſo gives a <hi>ſtanding Rule</hi> to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>entertainment of ſoul-ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours after Converſion and Aſſurance.</hi> If they have <hi>no warrant</hi> from the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> then why wilt thou entertain ſo much as a <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> with them? I think, <hi>uncomfortable thoughts</hi> ought to be caſt out <hi>without diſpute,</hi> as <hi>blaſphemous</hi> and <hi>atheiſtical ſuggestions</hi> in ſome caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how <hi>far,</hi> and in <hi>what caſes</hi> may it be be lawful to reject ſuch thoughts as tend to the queſtioning of Aſſurance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received, <hi>without diſpute?</hi> For it ſeems, the caſe of <hi>blaſphemous</hi> and <hi>atheiſtical ſuggeſtions,</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> we are now ſpeaking of, differs very much. Thoſe being at <hi>firſt bluſh</hi> (by any ſoul competently enlightned) to be diſcerned to be contrary to the <hi>expreſſe word</hi> of God, and ſo <hi>matters out of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:</hi> theſe (it may be) pretending <hi>ground</hi> from the <hi>Word;</hi> and being in their own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſuch as I am <hi>allowed to diſpute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is true, there is ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>matter</hi> of the ſuggeſtions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but yet as to <hi>mee</hi> and <hi>my caſe,</hi> they may be (in effect) the ſame. For I may
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:170084:240"/> by a preceding <hi>Aſſurance from the Spirit of God,</hi> be as much aſcertained <hi>that I am a child of God,</hi> as I am, <hi>that there is a God,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any other <hi>fundamentall</hi> point of Faith: So that I may be very well allowed the ſame way of proceeding in the <hi>one</hi> caſe, which I am preſcribed in the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I conceive I may doe ſo in theſe caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the preſent Doubts or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes concerning my condition, are not handed to me in the <hi>way and method of divine motions.</hi> Gods uſuall way of putting the ſoul upon enquiry concerning its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (to ſuch as enjoy <hi>Ordinances)</hi> being under the adminiſtration of them. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any ſuch ground, whether from the <hi>private working</hi> of my own <hi>thoughts,</hi> or from ſuch <hi>injections,</hi> as I can give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, I begin, <hi>after aſſurance,</hi> to fall a queſtioning mine own condition; I may wel fear the hand of <hi>Satan</hi> is in this, and I may ſilence them for the preſent, as coming to trouble my peace without a <hi>warrant.</hi> As if an <hi>Arrest</hi> ſhould be laid upon me, out of the ordinary way of Law, I may defend my ſelf by <hi>force,</hi> or eſcape by <hi>ſleight,</hi> and the Law will judg me in ſo doing to have done no more then what I might lawfully do.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When the preſent Diſpute concerning my ſtate and condition is impoſed upon me under ſuch <hi>circumſtances</hi> as render it unlikely to be managed <hi>candidly, cleerly,</hi> and <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:170084:241"/> ſo that there is no likelyhood but it ſhould rather end in <hi>confuſion,</hi> and further <hi>diſturbance,</hi> then <hi>peace</hi> and ſolid <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I ſhould be provoked to diſpute with an adverſary concerning ſuch or ſuch a point, at a <hi>time</hi> when I am not furniſhed with ſuch <hi>helps</hi> as a diſputant in that caſe may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully require, at ſuch a time when my <hi>mind,</hi> by reaſon of ſome great oppreſſion, or other buſineſſe is not <hi>at liberty</hi> to recollect its ſtrength, or before ſuch <hi>Judges</hi> as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>prepoſſeſſed</hi> by him, and ſtrongly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his ſide, &amp;c. I may very juſtifiably decline it, and anſwer his <hi>challenges</hi> with <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and <hi>provocations</hi> with <hi>ſlighting,</hi> ſeeing ſo diſingenuous a carriage on his part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no other: So, when I am ſollicited to put my evidences for ſalvation in diſpute, at ſuch a <hi>time</hi> when I want my wonted <hi>influences</hi> from the Spirit of God, when (as the Church <note place="margin">Pſalm 74. 9.</note> complains in another caſe) <hi>I ſee not my to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,</hi> when <hi>my ſpirits are overwhelmed,</hi> and ſwallowed up with the oppreſſion of ſoul-troubles; when laſtly, I perceive, I muſt plead my cauſe before <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> who are already prepoſſeſſed, and fee'd on the adverſaries ſide, I may very juſtly refuſe to enter the liſts upon ſuch terms, and reflect the diſgrace of ſo diſhonourable a challenge upon my adverſary, before God and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When I find ſuch doubts concerning
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:170084:241"/> my condition injected, or ſuggeſted <hi>upon Deſigne,</hi> to hinder and diſturbe mee in ſome <hi>preſent ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> wherein I have ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe of Aſſurance. To put them off, at leaſt, <hi>till a more convenient time</hi> (in ſuch a caſe) is a ſpecial part of ſpiritual wiſdome. It is found by the uſual experience of Gods Saints, that when they have <hi>moſt to do</hi> for their Aſſurance, they ſhall have it <hi>moſt to ſeek.</hi> Suppoſe when they go to <hi>pray,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon any extraordinary occaſion, when they addreſſe themſelves to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper,</hi> when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome <hi>heavy affliction,</hi> it may be when they are in ſome ſort called forth to <hi>ſuffer for God.</hi> Now it is plain, that when our doubts and troubles of ſpirit (in our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) uſually returne upon us at ſuch <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> they are then injected upon a <hi>ſpecial deſigne</hi> to hinder us in the preſent ſervices. Wherefore, ſeeing by admitting ſo much as a diſpute upon them, at ſuch a time, <hi>I yield the Divell his known deſigne,</hi> I may very ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject them; except I think it a courſe more eligible, to gratifie the enemy of Gods glory, and mine own good, with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or heartleſſe performance of a duty, then to break through a <hi>bug bear impediment</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely laid in my way, and ſet about it with that furniture which God hath graciouſly vouchſafed to enable me thereunto.</p>
               <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice for the Anſwer of this caſe concerning the way of turning a
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:170084:242"/> troubleſome incruder out of doors.</p>
               <p>But it may be farther objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Object.</label> But they <hi>pretend</hi> ſtill they come from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> &amp; (ſeeing you tell me the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi> of them, &amp; <hi>occaſional grounds</hi> of them may be from the Spirit of God, and I find withal that they have grown out of <hi>ſuch works of the ſpirit</hi> as you have but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) how ſhall I know how <hi>farre</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God leads me, and where Satans work begins, that I may <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the one, and <hi>reſiſt</hi> the other?</p>
               <p>

               <p>That whiles nothing is preſſed upon you, but what may ſtand with the <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> of a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed eſtate;</hi> what ever motions <hi>yeild you your title to God and grace,</hi> and (neither in their <hi>nature</hi> or in their <hi>grounds)</hi> tend to <hi>weaken</hi> your <hi>evidences,</hi> muſt be obeyed as the motions of Gods Spirit, though never ſo harſh or unpleaſing, as farre as they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny command or allowed example in the word. You muſt not take it for a motion of Satan, that bids you <hi>repent</hi> of, <hi>confeſſe, mourn</hi> for renewed <hi>ſinnes,</hi> that bids you <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi> your heart and ways, and turn to the Lord under afflictions, &amp;c. But if ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be improved to the queſtioning of the whole work of God upon the ſoul, this is

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Surely God hears <hi>ſinners,</hi> (in a ſenſe) or elſe hee hears not <hi>Saints:</hi> or (which is more abſurd) <hi>Saints are not ſinners.</hi> The truth is God hears not men in a ſinful ſtate, under the guilt and power of ſin; but hee hears men guilty of ſinfull acts; otherwiſe it were ſad with all the beſt men on earth. If thou doubt thou art in a ſinfull eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hears thee not, then I enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Did God ever hear thee</hi> formerly in the dayes of thy peace?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But (the truth is) the Argument is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious;

               <p n="3">3 How many Saints have complained of this uſage from God, That <hi>he covers himſelf with a thick cloud, that their prayers cannot paſſe thorow?</hi> That <hi>he fortifies againſt them, and when they cry and groan, hee ſhutteth out their prayer,</hi> Lam. 3. 8, 44.

Is it not the meere ſenſe of ſuch burthens, as, if you ſhould ſmother, would oppreſſe you utterly, that drives you to ſpeak theſe things of your ſelfe; and which (alſo) had not they been drawn from you by diſcourſe, you rather reſolved to have kept to your ſelfe? And call you this hypocrſie, for a poor ſlave under an intolerable burthen to groan to ſave his heart from breaking, by giving it ſome vent?</p>
               <p>3. Take heed of <hi>hypocriſie</hi> rather in this <hi>evaſion,</hi> and others of the like kind. If it be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, to <hi>endeavour to ſeem what we are not,</hi> then I fear complaints of hypocriſie many times are not altogether free from it. It may

And yet in theſe deſires are the breathings of a <hi>quickened</hi> and <hi>quickening</hi> Spirit, even the breathings of Gods Holy Spirit in thine.

Doſt thou find any thing <hi>ſweeter?</hi> It may be thy mouth is out of taſte to every thing elſe, as thou thinkeſt it is to them. But, tell me, is it not the <hi>dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of a Duty that makes thee diſ-reliſh it, and not any thing in the <hi>Duty it ſelf?</hi> It is becauſe thou art dead in duty, that thou art not delighted with it. It may be (if the Duty or Ordinance be <hi>publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> thou maiſt upon this account not be affected, becauſe it may not be managed with <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> or it may not be managed ſutably to thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thou diſ-reliſheſt all things that do not meet thy particular caſe. Herein (it is true) there is a failing, but it ſeems ſtill here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that thy diſaffection is not to the Duties and Ordinances themſelves, but only to the dreſſing of them. And this appeares, in that thou waiteſt on them ſtill, and expecteſt when God will make a match betweene thy

For (as I ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>fear</hi> is a <hi>living affection,</hi> and ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrences ariſe from fear. I never knew any ſoul in the caſe of the complainer, but if <hi>ſin</hi> were preſented to him, his very <hi>hair</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> would <hi>riſe</hi> againſt it.

Oh Sir, do you <hi>ſtartle,</hi> do <hi>rivers of tears run down your eyes, becauſe men keep not Gods law?</hi> Pſal. 119. 136. Do the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of them that reproach God fall upon you?</hi> Pſal. 69. 9. <hi>Is it as a ſword in your bones to hear men blaſpheme God, and diſpute down</hi>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> is ſo valiant that he <hi>drawes</hi> a <hi>ſword</hi> in Chriſts defence, and that againſt a whole <hi>Band of men,</hi> and follows him into the <hi>High Priests Hall;</hi> a little after, a <hi>ſilly maid</hi> daſheth his faith out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>(1) The truth is, the continued high act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>ſome</hi> graces are not fit for a <hi>mortal condition,</hi> and thoſe that wiſh them ſuch, <note place="margin">Job 4. 19.</note> are unmindful that they <hi>dwel in Tabernacles of clay,</hi> and <hi>that their foundation is laid in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is <hi>holy joy,</hi> which if kept up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to the height of <hi>ecſtaſie,</hi> muſt needs over-ſpread the ſpirits, and diſſolve nature.</p>
               <p>(2) Some Graces are of a mighty <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature,</hi> and bind the ſoul to the <hi>Object</hi> ſo, that it can mind nothing <hi>elſe</hi> during their impreſſions. Such are <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> Now
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:170084:256"/> God hath <hi>other graces</hi> to be acted; and <hi>works</hi> to be done by us, wherein we may glorifie him; and therefore allowes them their time alſo. Nay, a godly man is deſcribed by this, that he is a tree that <hi>brings forth fruit in the ſeaſon</hi> proper to it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>3. All the graces of Gods Saints, are, now and then, aſſaulted with <hi>ſtronger temptations,</hi> and <hi>powerfuller corruptions</hi> then at other times. And grace that will act high, when 'tis free from oppoſition, or under <hi>ſlender</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will not act ſo under <hi>greater.</hi> That ſtrength that will bear a hundred weight, will appear little or none at all when it comes to lift a thouſand.</p>
               <p>4. It may bee thy <hi>condition is altered,</hi> and thy grace is yet unacquainted with the way of managing a new condition. As an <hi>able ſcholar</hi> put out of his <hi>way of ſtudy,</hi> may be out-gone by a <hi>meaner,</hi> becauſe thoſe ſtudies to which he is diſuſed muſt needes bee entertained <hi>ſtrangely,</hi> and 'twill be ſome time ere he can get their <hi>familiar</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Here the fault is not in the abilities of the <hi>man,</hi> but in the newneſſe of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:</hi> ſo in point of grace; a very gracious man, and one who in <hi>ſome</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imployments, is excellent; in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> is to ſeeke, not for a <hi>toole</hi> to <hi>work</hi> with, but for <hi>skil</hi> to manage it. As a tradeſman when hee changeth his trade, loſeth not his <hi>skil of dealing</hi> in the world; but is unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the myſterie of putting it forth to <hi>preſent ſervice.</hi>

               <p>5. Many times God <hi>ſuffers</hi> decayes, and not only ſo, but <hi>inflicts</hi> them as chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon his deareſt people, that hee may make them,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Humble.</hi> So hee uſeth <hi>ſickneſſes of body</hi> to mind us that wee are <hi>men,</hi> and our breath is in his hand, and his onely.

               <p>(7) Many times <hi>decays</hi> may not be the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>actings of grace,</hi> but of our own <hi>over-actings.</hi> It may be, I may have had more <hi>ſeeming</hi> zeal formerly then now I ſeem to have.

Now (it may be) I <hi>truſt</hi> God, and am as <hi>zealous</hi> for him as formerly, but thoſe graces act more <hi>regularly,</hi> and not with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and diſtemper as formerly. So in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> for ſinne, many times worldly and ſelfiſh conſiderations mix with it, to heighten it; many times the <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>diſgrace</hi> that accompanies ſinne, the <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>croſſes</hi> that attend it, may bee ſome of thoſe things, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:170084:258"/> may heighten it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>habits</hi> of grace may not only <hi>ſtand</hi> at their <hi>former pitch,</hi> their <hi>bow may</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>abide in ſtrength,</hi> but may <hi>grow more radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> and be more ſtrengthened and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for more operations under the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>decays</hi> of the <hi>actings</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of them. As many times in the <hi>winter,</hi> a mans hands and feet may be benummed with <hi>cold,</hi> when his <hi>ſtomack</hi> and <hi>intrals</hi> are <hi>moſt hot.</hi> Now to underſtand this, you muſt know,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an <hi>univerſal habit</hi> of grace (allow me the expreſſion) which is called the <hi>new man, the new creature, &amp;c.</hi> And this univerſal habit of grace is like the <hi>habitual life and heate</hi> that is in the heart of a <hi>living body.</hi> There are alſo <hi>ſpecial habits</hi> of ſuch and ſuch particular graces, which ſymbolize with the <hi>heat and life</hi> which is in the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members</hi> of the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, as in the <hi>natural body,</hi> if the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> in a diſeaſe, though the <hi>out moſt members languiſh,</hi> the patient is in a hopefull way of recovery, and never the nearer death for loſing the fleſh off his ribs and face: ſo if the <hi>heart of grace,</hi> the main frame of grace in the ſoul, be ſtrengthened, the <hi>decayes</hi> in ſome <hi>actings of particula graces</hi> matter not much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The increaſe of <hi>any one particular grace</hi> ſtrengtheneth, and ſo farre improveth (in a ſort) the <hi>general habit of grace,</hi> though <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:170084:258"/> 
                  <hi>particular graces</hi> increaſe not. As the addition of a <hi>bucket</hi> of water to the <hi>Thames,</hi> makes the whole body and <hi>bulke of waters</hi> ſo much the bigger. And the <hi>tree</hi> is greater by the growth of <hi>one branch.</hi> A man is more <hi>gracious</hi> by the growth of humility, meekneſs, though (it may be) he is not more <hi>believing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There are <hi>particular habits of grace,</hi> and they (in themſelves) never <hi>decay,</hi> but they may be obſtructed and clogged as to their <hi>operations.</hi> Indeed, no <hi>gracious habit</hi> can properly be ſaid to <hi>grow</hi> or <hi>decay,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with reſpect to the <hi>acts</hi> that flow from it. For the nature of theſe <hi>divine qualities</hi> is not as that of <hi>moral habits,</hi> which are gotten by <hi>acts,</hi> and loſt by the <hi>diſuſe</hi> of them: theſe, being <hi>infuſed</hi> of God, and never to bee <hi>loſt,</hi> cannot <hi>decay,</hi> for then were they to bee loſt alſo; all <hi>corruptibleneſſe</hi> tending to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> That <hi>Souldier,</hi> that may be beaten from his <hi>firſt ground,</hi> if the aſſault bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, may be <hi>routed,</hi> and utterly <hi>beaten out of the field.</hi> Now that theſe things are ſo, appears; becauſe do but <hi>remove the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and grace in ſuch perſons will <hi>act as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly</hi> as ever it did. <hi>Samſons</hi> ſtrength ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not to be abated by his binding; for when he was looſe, hee laid the Philiſtines heaps upon heaps, as ever hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thou mayſt be <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> many times in that <hi>particular grace</hi> where thou thinkeſt
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:170084:259"/> thou art <hi>weakeſt.</hi> As that part of a garriſon may be <hi>beſt lined with men,</hi> where the <hi>bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark is loweſt.</hi> So the poor man that cryed out, <hi>Lord, help my unbelief,</hi> had then a greater faith, then he was aware of. And the poor <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> when ſhe dared not claim a <hi>childs</hi> portion, but ranks her ſelf with the <hi>dogges,</hi> yet relying ſtill on Chriſt for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of grace, was ſo eminent in faith, that Chriſt himſelf admires her for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a <hi>myſtery of godlineſſe</hi> in this which is not eaſily underſtood but by thoſe that have their ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent combats and conflicts.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſome <hi>general rules</hi> for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:170084:259"/> of this examination. Thoſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed you <hi>enquire not</hi> too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly after a <hi>too ſuddain improvement.</hi> If a man caſt his <hi>grain</hi> into the ground, it were unreaſonable, he ſhould complain it is <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe it appears not above ground the <hi>next day:</hi> or if he ſhould (walking in his field) every day, complain <hi>to day</hi> that it is grown nothing ſince yeſterday, becauſe he cannot diſcerne it. Had the man patience to look on it, at <hi>convenient diſtances of time,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience would confute him: many a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his inward frame to day with his frame yeſterday, and if he be not ſenſibly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſpiritual growth every day; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cryes, <hi>I grow not, but decay.</hi> Man, if thou wilt <hi>compare</hi> thy ſelf with what thou waſt, (to try thy growth) thou muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it, but by convenient diſtances of time. A man will be conceited, a <hi>child</hi> grows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that meaſures his height <hi>every day.</hi> Grace grows <hi>pedetentim, by little and little,</hi> by ſmall and undiſcernable acceſſions. An elegant diſcourſe upon this ſubject you have, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 26. 27. <hi>The Kingdom of God is as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day,</hi> to wit, to examine its growth, <hi>but it growes, he knows not how: i. e.</hi> inſenſibly. So when grace is ſown, and wrought in the heart, ſet a man compare himſelfe with what he was (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a competent diſtance of time as may render his growth diſcernable) he ſhall
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:170084:260"/> find it growes, though he know not how, that is, can give no account of every particular dayes improvement. A man would bee too ripe for earth too ſoone, if hee could ſenſibly recount his daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Compare</hi> not your ſelves too much <hi>with others,</hi> no not of the <hi>ſame ſtanding</hi> in the School of Chriſt with your ſelves, except it be now and then to ſhame your <hi>ſloath,</hi> and quicken your <hi>induſtry.</hi> But if you examine your growth by that rule, you may deceive your ſelves very eaſily. <hi>Rye</hi> and <hi>Wheat</hi> are ſowne near the ſame time, yet the <hi>one</hi> is but in the <hi>blade</hi> while the <hi>other</hi> is in the <hi>ear,</hi> and (notwithſtanding) <hi>both</hi> may be <hi>ripe</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some <hi>children</hi> ſhoot up mightily at <hi>firſt,</hi> and over-top all their contemporaries; but a <hi>while after</hi> a fit of ſickneſſe pulls them down; and they fall as much behind them, ſo that thoſe that they once outſtripped, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain come to outſtrip them, and may be at full growth as ſoon or ſooner. It may be thy ſickneſſes keep thee down at preſent, whiles others out-grow thee: labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, and thou wilt quickly top them again. The truth is, <hi>[ſlow, and ſure]</hi> is a good rule in this caſe, as in divers others, <hi>praecox ingenium,</hi> an <hi>over-ripe Infancy,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times is attended with a <hi>ſottiſh old age.</hi> Slow parts, followed with induſtry, hold out longer.</p>
               <p>Beſides, thou wouldſt want the <hi>ſpur</hi> of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:170084:260"/> holy emulation to quicken thee, if none ſhould out-go thee; thy being <hi>caſt behind,</hi> may <hi>win</hi> thee the <hi>Goal.</hi> That <hi>horſe</hi> (in a long Race) that is caſt a mile behind by the hot mettal of a fiery Competitor, many times out-runs him at long running, when his <hi>mettal</hi> hath a little <hi>beaten him off his legs.</hi> Laſtly, it may be that thou haſt <hi>no leſſe grace,</hi> but thou art not caſt upon the ſame exerciſe with others. Now it is <hi>exerciſe</hi> which makes <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> alſo, to be more <hi>ready,</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Examine not your growth in <hi>winter,</hi> which is not the <hi>growing ſeaſon.</hi> The ſtate of ſpiritual <hi>darkneſſe</hi> and ſoul <hi>troubles,</hi> is a very improper condition to examine ones growth in. 'Tis enough for graſs, and corn, and trees, to keep <hi>life</hi> in their <hi>roots</hi> in an hard winter; it is growth enough that they are not dead. So whiles thy ſoul-troubles laſt, 'tis well thou maintaineſt any ſpark of <hi>ſpiritual life,</hi> that thou art not quite killed with the extremity of the ſeaſon. In ſuch a time ſpread the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> about the <hi>Rock Chriſt,</hi> by acts of reliance in all Duties, and ſtand faſt, be not <hi>blown down</hi> by temptation: this is growth enough in ſuch a time. A more <hi>warm ſeaſon</hi> will come, and then the Sun will draw forth the <hi>ſap</hi> from the <hi>root</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>leaves</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Examine not your growth or decay of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> by the <hi>growth or decay of your Gifts.</hi> This were as if I ſhould examine a mans growth
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:170084:261"/> and improvement in a temporal <hi>eſtate</hi> by the fineneſſe or plainneſſe of his <hi>habit</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>garments. Gifts</hi> are but the <hi>garments</hi> of a Chriſtian. That mans <hi>purſe</hi> may bee full of <hi>gold,</hi> that goes in <hi>plain ruſſet,</hi> when another may have leſſe in his <hi>pocket</hi> then on his <hi>cloak.</hi> It is too frequently our fault, we judge our graces grow not, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray ſo fluently as we could, are ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>dram</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> is worth a <hi>pound</hi> of <hi>gifts.</hi> Many a man is like that <hi>Cardinal</hi> in the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> that would needs (for ſtate) march through <hi>London,</hi> with ſo many mules loaden. But by accident one of his beaſts flung off his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and diſcovered his Maſters affected pomp to be a meer pageantry, by the <hi>lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> that was ſcattered about the ſtreets. So many a man makes a great ſhew with <hi>gifts,</hi> but at laſt death comes, and knocks the <hi>trunk</hi> to pieces, and then he diſcovers, that how gawdy ſoever the <hi>out-ſide</hi> was, the <hi>inſide</hi> is as bare. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is like a <hi>Preacher.</hi> A young Scholar from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> preacheth higher ſtraines, but <hi>afterwards</hi> ſounder Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Judg not of your growth or decay in grace, by your frequent and ſtrong <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the aſſaults of ſtrong <hi>corruptions,</hi> or your ſometimes falling under them.</p>
               <p>I put theſe together, becauſe they are handled more at large in an excellent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical piece of a late <hi>early ripe</hi> labourer, who
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:170084:261"/> knew how to judg of growth by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, being ſo exceeding <hi>tall</hi> at ſo <hi>young</hi> an age, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love</hi> of Grace and its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees.</note> as makes many of his <hi>reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> aemulate him. You have (if you will needs judg by this rule) more ground to conclude your graces ſtrong and thriving; Becauſe God doth not uſe to lay <hi>great</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon <hi>weak</hi> ſhoulders, nor call forth a <hi>Pigmee</hi> to encounter with a <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Judge not of your growth and decayes in grace by your <hi>ability or diſability to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſervice.</hi> Nay, though you find it ſhort of what it was formerly. For preſent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities many times run low in the moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowne Saints that are. <hi>The men of might</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) could not find their hands,</hi> Pſa. 76 5. A Saint may be unable to <hi>find his hands</hi> when he is put upon a work; not that he <hi>wants</hi> them, but that he is by diſtemper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from <hi>uſing</hi> them. A man of <hi>one and twenty</hi> years old, in ſickneſſe and diſtemper, may not be able to do what he could at <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,</hi> and yet is growne for all that.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In <hi>ſpecial,</hi> I anſwer</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLV. A fourth Theſis, with its explication.</head>
               <p>NOw come we to the laſt Theſis from the Text, which is the fourth in this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That one principal work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption in the ſoul that hath received it, is to enliven and embolden it in prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may not miſtake in the ſenſe of the Propoſition, obſerve with mee firſt a few things tending to the <hi>Explication</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>When I ſay, a <hi>principal work,</hi> I mean not to compare the aſſiſtance he gives to prayer, with his work of <hi>uniting the ſoul to Chriſt</hi> in juſtification, of <hi>quickning the ſoul with habitual grace in Sanctification,</hi> or the work of Aſſurance it ſelf. For no <hi>ſtream</hi> can rationally be admitted into compariſon with its fountain. Now the Spirit of <hi>prayer</hi> is but an <hi>emanation</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>Adoption,</hi> firſt a <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> and then a <hi>Spirit of ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. And therefore this muſt be underſtood of thoſe <hi>operations</hi> which <hi>flow</hi> from habitual grace and Aſſurance, that <hi>of them</hi> there is no nobler act of the Spirit of Grace and Adoption (enabling us to, and in them) then this.</p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:170084:264"/>
               <p>
                  <label>Qu.</label> 1. What <hi>act</hi> of the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus works?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> When I ſpeak of this <hi>particular boldneſſe</hi> as the work of the Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, I would be underſtood, of the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> chiefly in his <hi>witneſſing</hi> Act (of which we have hitherto principall treated) though I ſhall not here (more then in the former point) exclude him in his <hi>other</hi> acts: only I ſhall ſhew from which work of the Spirit of Adoption this which wee treat of doth <hi>more immediatly</hi> ariſe. For whereas, I before told you <hi>twice,</hi> of four works of the Spirit of Adoption, to <hi>unite,</hi> to <hi>witneſſe,</hi> to <hi>intercede,</hi> to <hi>direct:</hi> whereof the <hi>uniting act</hi> is the moſt noble, and the fountain of all the <hi>reſt, union</hi> with Chriſt being the ſource of all <hi>communion:</hi> you muſt farther know, that the <hi>reſt</hi> of theſe Acts do not <hi>alike primarily</hi> flow from the <hi>firſt,</hi> but by the <hi>meditation</hi> and <hi>interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of one another. The ſpirit <hi>intercedes in us,</hi> but by the help of his <hi>aſsuring</hi> work he produceth its moſt fervent, and confident petitions. And (the laſt work) his <hi>guiding</hi> work, he performes by <hi>both</hi> the former; <hi>viz.</hi> perſwading the ſoul upon aſſurance of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to fetch direction, and aſſiſtance from God in all its wayes by faith in the promiſes and prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 2. Doth the Spirit work thus in all Saints?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. When I ſay, it is the work of the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:170084:264"/> Spirit of Adoption, I muſt not be underſtood to affirme a <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>perpetual aſſistance</hi> of the witneſſing Spirit in <hi>all</hi> the Saints, to the performance of this Duty, in <hi>a like</hi> high, ſpiritfull, and confident way. For the deareſt Saints of God, whiles they enjoy the Spirit of Adoption, may be under ſtrange <hi>deadneſſe, diſtraction,</hi> and <hi>indoſpoſedneſſe</hi> in Duty; and under no leſſe <hi>doubting, ſuſpiciouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>jealouſie</hi> of God, and his affectons to them, which muſt needs hinder their <hi>boldneſs</hi> in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him <hi>[Father.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Thus (accordingly) as we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh <hi>times,</hi> ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween degrees of livelineſſe and boldneſſe in praying. Between <hi>praying to God</hi> as to a [Father,] and calling him <hi>[Father] aloud</hi> in <hi>Prayer;</hi> or (as in the words of the Text) <hi>crying, Abba, Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Spirit, as He <hi>unites</hi> the ſoul to Chriſt, is a <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> helps us to pray, and that with life and boldneſſe. But becauſe he may (poſſibly) not alwayes act in his witneſſing way, (although even then, the ſoul is enabled to pray acceptably) it may not alwayes be the condition of a Saint to <hi>cal</hi> God <hi>[Father,]</hi> with alike <hi>confidence;</hi> whiles yet he may pray with abundance of holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
               <p>(3) Diſtinguiſh therefore between that <hi>livelineſſe</hi> and <hi>boldneſſe</hi> of the ſoul in prayer, which flowes from the actual witneſſe of the Spirit, and that which ariſeth meerly from
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:170084:265"/> the gracious influence of the ſame Spirit, as he <hi>unites</hi> us to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>(1) As for <hi>livelineſs in prayer,</hi> it may in a godly man proceed not only from the Spirits witneſs, but ſometimes from</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſcience of Duty.</hi> When a man quickens up his <hi>deſires</hi> and other <hi>affections,</hi> upon this conſideration, that he is in the preſence of a <hi>living</hi> God, and therefore it becomes him not to offer <hi>dead</hi> ſervices to ſuch a God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Or from <hi>ſenſe of want.</hi> That is it which uſually addes life and activity to our endeavours. <hi>Beggars,</hi> when ready to <hi>ſtarve,</hi> are <hi>importunate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Or thirdly from <hi>hope to ſpeed.</hi> Now this hope to ſpeed is either <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> which I receive from a paricular aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods engagements to me; or more <hi>general</hi> and <hi>negative,</hi> taking away all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements which I may fancy to my ſelf. Now the <hi>former</hi> hope, a man under the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing act of the Spirit prayes by, the <hi>latter</hi> quickens every godly Chriſtian, whether he <hi>have</hi> actually, or ever <hi>had</hi> the teſtimony of the Spirit, or no.</p>
               <p>Now the hopes of a Saint are grounded either on <hi>certainties,</hi> or <hi>probabilities:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities remove <hi>diſcouragements,</hi> certainties only give a poſitive and particular, well grounded <hi>hope.</hi> And yet <hi>probabilities</hi> may <hi>enliven,</hi> though <hi>certainties</hi> do farre more. A ſoul may come upon the <hi>general encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:170084:265"/> upon which God inviteth <hi>ſinners to come to him,</hi> and may thereby be much <hi>enlivened</hi> in prayer, although not with <hi>ſo great life</hi> and vigour as a man that can plead a <hi>particular right and title</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>(2.) So concerning <hi>boldneſſe</hi> of the ſoul in Duty: A ſoul that walks in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> may be <hi>bold,</hi> in ſome ſort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon <hi>ſenſe of want,</hi> which diſpells all <hi>ſhamefaſtneſs.</hi> A man in neceſſity, though he dared not open his mouth before to aske relief of a great perſonage, through <hi>ſhame,</hi> keeping him back from it; yet when there is <hi>no help,</hi> he will <hi>put a good face</hi> upon it (as we ſay) and embolden himſelf to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſollicite ſupplies. So the ſoul ſays in ſuch a caſe, I muſt <hi>begge</hi> my life or <hi>periſh, aske</hi> or <hi>ſtarve for want of ſupply;</hi> I will adventure into the preſence of God (as <hi>Heſter</hi> into the preſence of the King) <hi>and if I periſh, I periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the <hi>diſcoveries</hi> that the Scripture makes <hi>of the nature of God,</hi> that he is a God of infinite mercies, that <hi>wayts to be gracious,</hi> &amp; expects opportunities to manifeſt it. A man will (when he is in want) more boldly adventure to aske of <hi>a man</hi> who is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>propenſe to acts of bounty,</hi> and ready upon all occaſions to manifeſt it, then of <hi>another,</hi> whoſe diſpoſition is not ſo known. <hi>Thou art a God that heareſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come, Pſalm</hi> 65. 2.</p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:170084:266"/>
               <p n="3">3. Upon encouragements of <hi>invitations, promiſes, examples.</hi> Such as, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will anſwer thee,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. And that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man have no <hi>particular</hi> ground to conclude, that he ſhall be heard, yet upon theſe <hi>general</hi> grounds, he can many times urge God very confidently.</p>
               <p>But a ſoul under the actual Teſtimony of the Spirit of God may embolden himſelfe from a <hi>particular intereſt,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 94. <hi>Lord, I am thine, ſave me.</hi> And the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 19. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 2. <hi>Preſerve my ſoul, for I am holy,</hi> or one whom thou favoureſt.

Thou haſt been favourable to thy Land, Pſalm</hi> 85. 1.</p>
               <p>The point, therefore, is to be underſtood thus, <hi>where the Spirit of God is actu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THat this is a principal <hi>work of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſing Spirit of Adoption, to raiſe the fervencie and boldneſs of the ſoul in prayer,</hi> may be evidenced to us by the <hi>parallell</hi> place of Scripture, Gal. 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſonnes God hath ſent the Spirit of his ſonne into your hearts.</hi> It is to be underſtood of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing acts of the Spirit, becauſe this gift followes upon <hi>ſonſhip, [becauſe ye are ſons:]</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>[that you might be ſons:]</hi> then (indeed) it muſt have been underſtood of the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> and <hi>uniting</hi> grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which <hi>makes ſons;</hi> but <hi>[becauſe ye are ſons]</hi> which ſuppoſeth their preſent ſtanding as children, to be the ground of this gift, and therefore it is underſtood of the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing</hi> act of the Spirit. And what followes from it? What get they by this Spirit of Chriſt adminiſtred in this way? what doth the Spirit there? <hi>He cryes,</hi> not <hi>[enables them to cry]</hi> (though that be true;) but <hi>he cryes</hi> (in them) <hi>Abba, Father:</hi> cryes, (with <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe) Father,</hi> (with <hi>confidence;)</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Father,</hi> (with holy <hi>importunity.)</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <head>CHAP. XLVII. Two Caſes ſtated; whether Saints are at all times alike heightened in their ſpirits in prayer. And if not, whence the difference that is in them at ſeveral times, proceeds?</head>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Que.</hi>1 </label> ARe <hi>all</hi> that have received the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit, at <hi>all</hi> times <hi>alike</hi> bold in prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Que.</hi>2. </label> If not, how comes it to paſſe, that there is ſuch an alteration in the ſpirits of Gods people? That at <hi>one</hi> time they are <hi>more</hi> bold, and fervent in prayer, then at <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> For anſwer to the firſt of theſe; you are to know.</p>
               <p>(1.) That the <hi>boldneſſe</hi> of Gods people in prayer <hi>depends</hi> not upon the <hi>reception of the witneſs in themſelves,</hi> but upon the <hi>actual improvement of that teſtimony.</hi> If a man have never ſo good an evidence lying by him, and he have it not ready to produce <hi>in Court,</hi> when he is pleading his cauſe, he cannot be ſo confident in his plea, as at another time when he hath it in his hand. And therefore,</p>
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:170084:268"/>
               <p>(2) The beſt of Gods Saints (as I have ſhewed you before) may not <hi>at all times have his Evidences at hand</hi> to plead. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Saint dares not ſometimes to owne his relation to God, and their Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance admits of actual ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>(3) Thereupon (no doubt) there muſt needs be leſſe life and confidence in drawing nigh to God. For at ſuch a time</p>
               <p n="1">1 All the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are like a <hi>Book ſealed</hi> to the ſoul. In all the word of God, it cannot find one Promiſe that it can urge with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Spirits Teſtimony</hi> is the only <hi>light</hi> in which we can challenge and lay claim to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Promiſes are the very <hi>ſpirits and life</hi> of prayer. Becauſe they are the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon which the Soul can claim any thing from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſuch a ſeaſon, the <hi>relations between God and the ſoul are clouded.</hi> The ſoul <hi>thinks</hi> God an <hi>enemy</hi> oftentimes, and alwayes (in ſuch a condition) <hi>questions</hi> (at leaſt) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a <hi>friend,</hi> or rather whether he be not a meer <hi>ſtranger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſurely a man will have little <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>face,</hi> to prefer a petition to one whoſe <hi>love</hi> he ſuſpects; much leſs, to one whom by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities he judgeth to be an <hi>enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 In ſuch a ſeaſon all <hi>graces</hi> (that are the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:170084:269"/> very <hi>lungs</hi> whence prayer is <hi>breathed) are very low and flat in their actings.</hi> The abſence of the <hi>Sun</hi> in winter makes the <hi>plants</hi> caſt their <hi>leaves,</hi> and pluck in their <hi>bloſſoms;</hi> and the abſence of the Spirit muſt needs make graces look <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>withered,</hi> and <hi>ſapleſſe.</hi> True, there is life in the <hi>root,</hi> but little <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;</hi> graces are <hi>benumm'd</hi> in ſuch a ſeaſon, and cannot act ſo freely as at other times. As <hi>Samſon,</hi> when his ſpirit of ſtrength from thr Lord had left him, thought to have <hi>gone forth and ſhaken himſelf as at other times,</hi> but he could not. A man thinks under ſpiritual with-drawings of God, <hi>Now I will rub up my graces, and beſtir my ſelf in prayer as at other times,</hi> but he is deceived, the Spirit of God is with-drawn from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</label> But ſhew more <hi>particularly</hi> from whence this <hi>variety of tempers</hi> in prayer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> What ever <hi>clouds the teſtimony of the Spirit</hi> (and I have ſpoken much to that Head before) muſt needs cauſe this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the frame of Gods people in prayer.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer more <hi>particularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 It may be <hi>neglect of our frequent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to God in that way.</hi> A friend that a man converſeth with <hi>every day,</hi> he can ſpeak more boldly and familiarly to, then one that he ſees but <hi>now and then.</hi> When a ſoul viſits God but <hi>now and then,</hi> there grow <hi>ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:170084:269"/> and <hi>jealouſies</hi> betweene God and him; and a man is to ſeek whether he be the <hi>ſame</hi> to him as he was in times paſt, and ſo ſpeaks to him with more <hi>faintneſſe</hi> and <hi>flatneſſe</hi> of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It may be a <hi>freſh guilt of ſin admitted into the conſcience.</hi> This, as it weakens Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo it faints prayer. A <hi>child</hi> ſcarce dares come to ask a favour from a <hi>diſpleaſed Father.</hi> And how unwilling we are under ſuch conſciouſneſſe of guilt to come to God in prayer, ſee in two examples. Of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 40. 12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, ſo that I cannot look up.</hi> In <hi>former</hi> times, I could have <hi>looked up</hi> with life and confidence in prayer, but now they force me to <hi>hang down my head:</hi> yea, they are <hi>more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> I have neither the <hi>face,</hi> nor the heart to come to God which I have had.</p>
               <p>The other example is, that of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when he had been <hi>ſowing his wild oats,</hi> and began to return towards his Father: ſee how <hi>low</hi> he ſpeaks, <hi>Father, I am not worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> &amp;c. and yet he ſtill had the comfort of his relation in ſome meaſure: he could ſay, <hi>Father</hi> ſtill. How much <hi>lower</hi> muſt a ſoul ſpeak, that hath ſinned away the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> or (at leaſt) preſent <hi>ſenſe</hi> of that dear <hi>relation?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="522" facs="tcp:170084:270"/>
               <p n="3">3 Many times the ſtream of life and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in prayer runs low, <hi>for want of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quicken our graces;</hi> and this even under the <hi>ſenſe of Aſſurance.</hi> For a man may live in the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> and that may prove a <hi>temptation</hi> to him to walk more <hi>ſleightly,</hi> and not make ſuch <hi>preparations</hi> for communion with God in a Duty as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When a <hi>friend</hi> growes a <hi>daily</hi> gueſt, we do not feaſt him as when hee comes but <hi>ſeldom;</hi> we then entertaine him with <hi>houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold fare;</hi> whereas if hee viſited us but now and then, we would (as we ſay) <hi>make a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of him,</hi> and provide for him of the beſt. So when God growes a daily gueſt to a ſoul, he is apt to grow bold, to addreſſe himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f to him with an ordinary frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Spirit; to make no extraordinary preparations, by trimming up his graces, and laying out his ſtrength in Duty: and when God ſees this, he frownes, and we hang down our heads when we come to him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</label> Undoubtedly, <hi>he doth not.</hi> And of this we have a very remarkable proof in this very Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. The Spirit helps ſometimes in <hi>words at large,</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſupplies us with <hi>groans</hi> only. Nor is it <hi>need</hi> he <hi>ſhould.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Theſe</hi> are but the <hi>outward gayety, pomp,</hi> and <hi>hangings of Devotion.</hi> Now <hi>garments</hi> themſelves are no part of the <hi>man,</hi> nor things <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to the life of man; much leſſe are the <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> of <hi>trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> and <hi>faſhions</hi> neceſſary. The outward garb of the <hi>body,</hi> &amp; the outward garb of <hi>duty,</hi> prevail alike with God, that is, juſt nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Yet let me not hereby occaſion in any one a
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:170084:271"/> 
                  <hi>lazy,</hi> and <hi>ſupine</hi> neglect of expreſſions. Though <hi>utterance</hi> be not a <hi>grace,</hi> (and God accepts and delights in nothing but grace,) yet it is a <hi>gift,</hi> and God will not have gifts ſlighted, or wilfully neglected, and ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to decay for want of blowing up. But however, if (by no <hi>neglect of mine own)</hi> I am ſhut up, that I cannot expreſſe my ſelf, I muſt not preſently conclude, that my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that I offer up with broken ſighes and groans, have not all things neceſſary to their acceptance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Theſe</hi> are many times the <hi>fewel of our corruption,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>pride, vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-advancement</hi> in the preſence of God, and it is oftentimes a very great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that Gods Spirit with-drawes the actual exerciſe of that gift from us, which we are apt to abuſe ſo much to his diſhonour, and our own diſadvantage. How many perſons are there, eſpecially in theſe dayes, that make elegancy and fluency of expreſſions in prayer, a matter of <hi>emulation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Theſe</hi> are many times the <hi>excellencies of unſanctified men.</hi> No <hi>real friend</hi> uſeth to be ſo liberal in words of Ceremony and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, as a <hi>complementing Courtier,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not a word of what he ſayes. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> could <hi>make long prayers,</hi> Mat. 13 14. but the <hi>Publican</hi> that was more <hi>in earneſt,</hi> is quickly at an <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>Devotion,</hi> for want of expreſſions or boldneſſe to ſpeak more. 'Twas <hi>ſhort and ſweet,</hi> (as we ſay.) I am
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:170084:271"/> perſwaded the <hi>Divel</hi> may be a <hi>falſe Spirit of prayer</hi> in the mouths of many Hereticks and Seducers in theſe dayes, as well as a <hi>falſe Spirit of propheſie</hi> (of old) in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs Prophets,</hi> 1 King 22. 22. Men ſhall never want <hi>tools,</hi> that do the <hi>divels work.</hi> Some <hi>men pray</hi> like <hi>Angels,</hi> as <hi>Parots</hi> ſpeak like <hi>men,</hi> and yet both ſay leaſt of what they ſay.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Theſe may be an occaſion <hi>of greateſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in prayer;</hi> if continued. We ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily account a <hi>form of words</hi> to be a <hi>form of prayer.</hi> I tell you friends, there may be as much <hi>formality,</hi> in an <hi>unſtinted fluency of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi> That is the form of any <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> which <hi>moſt reſembles it,</hi> and yet is not <hi>what it reſembles.</hi> Aſſuredly, fluent and fervent expreſſions in prayer, carry the moſt glorious <hi>appearance,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of a ſpiritual Duty that can be. Many a man therefore ſits down in <hi>them,</hi> as other perſons do in an <hi>external Leiturgy,</hi> and places all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a few <hi>ſpiritual Complements</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>Yet would I not have theſe expreſſions of mine any way abuſed to the juſtification of the <hi>ſtinted formaliſts Devotions,</hi> in which uſually perſons of <hi>that ſtrain</hi> place their <hi>whole Religion.</hi> Undoubtedly, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe a <hi>crutch</hi> when we are <hi>lame,</hi> and a <hi>go-cart</hi> whiles we are <hi>children.</hi> Young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners may find help in the <hi>matter, method,</hi> and <hi>language</hi> of prayer from a <hi>good form;</hi>
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:170084:272"/> and I know not but under <hi>extraordinary deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies</hi> &amp; <hi>ſwoundings</hi> of ſpiriti, n which the ſoul cannot put forth its operations as before; a godly man may (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in his <hi>Agony)</hi> go, and repeat to God <hi>thrice and more the ſame</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 2</label> Add moreover that Elegancy and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of expreſſions, though <hi>ſometimes</hi> they <hi>are, yet are not alwayes</hi> the work of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> I dare not ſay the Spirit doth not <hi>many times</hi> ſuggeſt the very <hi>language</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as well as he ſuggeſted the very <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>ſtrange tongues</hi> with which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpake, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I know alſo, that <hi>much of the life and vigour of expreſſion</hi> in prayer is from our own <hi>parts.</hi> There is much <hi>Art</hi> in expreſſion, and (ſo) much of our <hi>own;</hi> flouriſhes of ſtudied or elaborate <hi>Oratory, Rhetorical</hi> termes, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>affection,</hi> from the <hi>affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateneſſe</hi> of our owne <hi>expreſſions.</hi> Some things of this nature may appear in <hi>prayer,</hi> which would be the ſame, if I were making a ſerious ſpeech about a matter of concernment before a <hi>mortal man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you may <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> ſupplies received
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:170084:272"/> from the <hi>Spirit</hi> in this kind, from <hi>others,</hi> by theſe probable ſignes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Supplies of language from the Spirit, are more <hi>natural,</hi> and leſſe <hi>strained for.</hi> That that a man ſpeakes from a <hi>principle within,</hi> is ordinarily delivered in a kind of <hi>natural elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> But what is meerly <hi>lip-labour,</hi> is <hi>over-done;</hi> expreſſions are more <hi>forced,</hi> and there is more of <hi>invention</hi> in them: And ſo it is in prayer; the Spirit is the moſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> principle of prayer to a gracious man. He followes in nothing ſo <hi>freely,</hi> as when he is <hi>led by the Spirit;</hi> his own <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> actions are not <hi>freer</hi> and more <hi>unforced</hi> then <hi>gracious</hi> actions are. The more <hi>ſtudy</hi> there is for <hi>terms</hi> to expreſſe a mans ſelfe; the more of the <hi>head</hi> there is in prayer, moſt commonly, the leſſe there is of the <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">2 The more <hi>humble acknowledgement of your own impotency to pray,</hi> you enter upon the duty withal, the <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in your <hi>after enlargements.</hi> A ſoul that goes to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in its <hi>own</hi> ſtrength, is not acquainted with ſuch <hi>ſelf-abaſing</hi> thoughts, but out of the experience of former abilities, thinks as <hi>Samſon,</hi> I will go out now and ſhake my ſelf as at other times, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16 20. Such an one goes to <hi>prayer,</hi> as a <hi>Scholar</hi> to ſtudy a <hi>ſpeech,</hi> out of the ſtrength of his reading and invention.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The enlargements of <hi>expreſſion</hi> which proceed from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are not a <hi>conſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:170084:273"/> 
                  <hi>ſupply.</hi> When men pray <hi>always</hi> with the <hi>ſame</hi> fluency of expreſſion, 'tis a ſad token there is much of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>art</hi> in ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Spirit (I confeſſe) may give ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſupplies, but yet the ſoul ſhall obſerve, now and then, the <hi>ſtream</hi> runs more <hi>low</hi> and <hi>still,</hi> eſpecially upon ſome ſuch occaſion, as (I have before ſhewn) may make the Spirit withdraw his influences that enable in duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is as great an height in <hi>affections,</hi> when the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſuggeſts matter of prayer, as in <hi>expreſſions.</hi> Without all queſtion, the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> when hee ſupplies, will not ſupply the <hi>leſſe</hi> materiall part of prayer, and not the more <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>momentous.</hi> A man of a <hi>nimble invention,</hi> and a <hi>fluent tongue,</hi> may be able to ſpeak <hi>high ſtrains of Rhetorick</hi> in prayer; but is the <hi>heart</hi> warmed ſutably to the <hi>expreſſions?</hi> If the ſtream run only <hi>from the teeth outward</hi> (as we ſay) 'tis not ſupplied from a <hi>divine ſpring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>warmed</hi> alſo, yet, I ask, doth its <hi>warmth</hi> produce the <hi>language</hi> of prayer; or rather, the <hi>language, it?</hi> Some <hi>good natures</hi> (as we call them) will <hi>weep</hi> at a paſſionate diſcourſe, either of their <hi>own</hi> or <hi>another mans.</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>first</hi> hot, where the expreſſions are from the Spirit. It may be, <hi>expreſſions</hi> may add to the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>heart-affection</hi> in duty: as (on the other ſide) <hi>dull expreſſions</hi> will much take off from the <hi>edge of a good affection.</hi> But whence was the <hi>riſe</hi> of thy heate, in the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of it? from
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:170084:273"/> 
                  <hi>without,</hi> or from <hi>within?</hi> A <hi>natural</hi> mans <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> in prayer, are the <hi>ſpring</hi> of his <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:</hi> a <hi>godly</hi> mans <hi>affections,</hi> are the <hi>ſpring</hi> of his <hi>expreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Adde alſo, that the <hi>fayling of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in prayer, is much <hi>our own</hi> fault.</p>

               <p>NOw to <hi>apply</hi> this uſefull point.</p>
               <p>1. In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, this lets many poor ſouls, under darkneſſe, know whence that <hi>deadneſſe</hi> and <hi>flatneſſe</hi> of ſpirit which they are ever complaing of in prayer, doth proceed. They do what they can, to <hi>darken their evidences,</hi> and take delight in finding matter of <hi>charge</hi> againſt themſelves, to the <hi>ſhaking</hi> of them, and yet take it ill, that they cannot have that <hi>freedome,</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>livelyneſſe</hi> in prayer, which they deſire. This is as if they ſhould <hi>cut off</hi> their own <hi>legs,</hi> and then complain that they cannot <hi>go.</hi> They clip the very <hi>wings</hi> upon which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould raiſe it ſelf heaven-ward, and then they complain they cannot <hi>fly</hi> ſo <hi>high</hi> in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as they would.</p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:170084:275"/>
               <p>
                  <label>Qu.</label> But what ſhall I do if by reaſon of this darkneſſe I cannot call God <hi>Father,</hi> with confidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 1. Acknowledge, with ſenſe and feeling, that <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> of thine which diſcourageth thee. Say, <hi>Lord, I confeſſe, I am unworthy to be called thy ſonne</hi> (as the Prodigal doth) and endeavour (as much as thou canſt) to fill thy face with ſhame and confuſion in the ſenſe hereof.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Acquaint</hi> him with thy <hi>particular ſtraightneſſe</hi> of ſpirit, and the cauſe of it; tell him what tyes thy tongue, that thou wouldſt pray, but thou dareſt not own any relation to him; deſire him, for his own <hi>glory,</hi> to diſcover that relation to thee, that may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden thee to his <hi>ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Maintain</hi> (notwithſtanding this) <hi>thy claim</hi> to God, as thy <hi>Father,</hi> upon thoſe promiſes upon which at firſt thou didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. God warrants every ſoul to <hi>call him Father,</hi> that is brought to a deſire to become <hi>his child.</hi> None ever call'd God <hi>Father,</hi> out of a ſincere deſire to that <hi>relation,</hi> and the <hi>duties</hi> of it, from whom God refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the title. We never find God quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with any, upon this account, for calling him <hi>Father,</hi> except they were ſuch as deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him <hi>filial duty,</hi> and <hi>reverence.</hi> Suppoſing then that thou canſt not call God <hi>Father,</hi> upon evidence of particular faith, yet do it upon grounds of relyance, ſuch as his offers, invitations, promiſes: plead that promiſe
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:170084:275"/> of Relation, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>4 Ask <hi>ſpiritual good things</hi> of him under the <hi>obligation</hi> of that <hi>relation.</hi> And urge him with his <hi>Fatherly bowels</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, to all poor ſouls that come unto God through him. Call him <hi>Father at adventure,</hi> upon Chriſts ſcore, and ſee whether he can diſclaim the name. The advantage of this will be the hearing and granting of thy petitions; and the <hi>Anſwer of prayer,</hi> will be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thine <hi>Intereſt.</hi> No greater <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Aſſurance,</hi> then the <hi>Anſwer of our Prayers,</hi> Pſal 66. 19. See what a kind of Argument the holy man drawes Aſſurance from in that place, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer. But verily God hath heard me:</hi> That is, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Propoſition; the <hi>Concluſion</hi> is <hi>natural;</hi> therefore, <hi>I do not regard iniquity in my heart</hi> So in this Caſe, the Argument will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable.

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> (1) Then ſenſibly <hi>confeſſe</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile</hi> that ſin before God. Acknowledge that thou doſt not only deſerve the darkning of <hi>thine own faith,</hi> but alſo the darkning of <hi>his face,</hi> and that not only here, but hereafter
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:170084:276"/> for ever. That thou canſt not tell with what face to call him Father, having ſo miſ-behaved thy ſelf towards him.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Apply</hi> thy ſelf to his <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> for <hi>renewed pardon,</hi> and that the ſenſe of that pardon may open thy mouth again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51 12, 13, 15.</p>
               <p>(3) Conſider, thy <hi>acceptance</hi> depends not on thine own <hi>worthineſſe,</hi> but on his meer <hi>mercy and goodneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is an Advocate for ſinners, and a Propitiation for ſins, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>(4) <hi>Put a bold face upon it,</hi> (as wee ſay) and adventure (as before) upon the claim of that <hi>relation,</hi> and uſe it in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all neceſſary grace from God; reſolving in caſe thou ever ſee his face again in love, (yea, though thou ſhouldſt never ſee it again) to watch againſt thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for time to come, and walk more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully under the <hi>Obligation of that relation</hi> then ever before. Follow on this courſe though againſt the grain of thy own jealous heart, and thou wilt find thy heart grow warm, and thy pulſe more quick by a ſenſible recovery of loſt ſpirits and life to thy prayers.</p>
               <p>II. This lets us know how we may <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> when we have; and <hi>recover</hi> when we have loſt, the heat of our affections, and confidence of our hearts in Prayer; to wit, by maintaining our <hi>Aſſurance of Gods love,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14, 15. The Apoſtle writes to them whom he endeavours by ſeveral tokens to
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:170084:276"/> aſſure that they are the children of God, and then drawes up the advantage of that Aſſurance. <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in,</hi> (or <hi>concerning) him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The way then to <hi>keep</hi> preſent, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> loſt boldneſſe, is to keep and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new <hi>aſſurance of Gods love</hi> by the Spirit: How you may do that, I have ſhewne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at large, and ſo ſhall ſpare repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here.</p>

               <p>(1) To be <hi>much in Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1 Thoſe that <hi>have it not,</hi> are not to <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> it, nor are they excuſable for <hi>ſlighting it</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:170084:277"/> 
                  <hi>over,</hi> who <hi>walk in darkneſſe.</hi> Now, if they muſt drive on in this rode, who (becauſe the <hi>wheels of their Chariots are taken off,)</hi> muſt needs <hi>drive heavily:</hi> how are you bound who have wheels, and thoſe oyled too, that you may go on the more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</p>
               <p n="2">(2. If God ſhould <hi>with-draw</hi> (what you neglect) the comfortable refreſhments of his Spirit, and make you <hi>howle</hi> after him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpiritual darkneſſe, in a <hi>wide and howling wilderneſſe</hi> of deſertions and temptations, you will find a difference between ſailing in a <hi>clear day</hi> and a <hi>calm ſea;</hi> and ſteering the ſame veſſel in a <hi>dark night</hi> and <hi>ſtormy ſea,</hi> when neither Sun, nor Moon, nor Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to direct the courſe. And then you will wiſh you had uſed days of ſpiritual peace for maintaining <hi>Trade</hi> with God. <hi>Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times</hi> are bad times to <hi>trade</hi> in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The uncertainty of Adventures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes, muſt needs cool the Merchants endeavours.</p>
               <p n="3">(3 Others <hi>may,</hi> but you <hi>muſt</hi> prevail with God. I mean, the <hi>arrowes</hi> of prayer, which by ſouls in darkneſſe are ſhot <hi>at adventure</hi> are not altogether without <hi>hope of acceptance;</hi> but yours are beyond <hi>poſſibility of miſcarrying,</hi> and that not only in <hi>themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but to <hi>you</hi> alſo, you being in the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, are particularly aſſured, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ask according to his Word, he heareth you,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14, 15.</p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:170084:277"/>
               <p n="4">(4 <hi>Hopes</hi> to ſpeed are the <hi>wings</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Aſſurance (as I before have ſhewed) will be <hi>maintained</hi> by prayer, and <hi>weakned</hi> by the neglect of it. Let a man be never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with a friend, and never ſo certainly aſſured of his love, yet diſuſe of entercourſe will occaſion jealouſie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, or at leaſt ſhyneſſe and feare of being too bold with each other.</p>
               <p n="5">(5 You <hi>wrong</hi> many <hi>others.</hi> You are the <hi>Favourites</hi> of heaven; how many <hi>Petitions</hi> of poor dark Saints in corners, are put into your hands for diſpatch to the Throne of Grace? How many <hi>occaſions</hi> wherein you may ſerve the Church, <hi>come athwart</hi> you (as wee ſay) daily? And can you betray all theſe by your negligence of improving your intereſt at the Throne of God? No man may do more good, if he attend with diligence and watchfulneſſe, then an honeſt Favourite to an earthly Prince. You muſt not pray for <hi>your ſelves only,</hi> but for <hi>them that cannot pray</hi> too. You that are Gods Favourites may do much good if you beſtir your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">(6 Know this alſo, that God <hi>delights in the Muſick of your Prayers.</hi> Other men alwayes find matter of <hi>complaint,</hi> but you are more fitted for <hi>Sacrifices of praiſe.</hi> And <hi>he that offereth praiſe glorifieth God,</hi> and ſo 'tis no wonder if God delight moſt in ſuch a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner. I muſt not be underſtood, as if God did not alſo delight in the <hi>ſaddeſt complaints</hi>
                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:170084:278"/> of a troubled ſpirit, as they are offered up to him in a way of <hi>Petition.</hi> But yet ſurely, (I think I may ſay) God loves that Prayer moſt that moſt carries man out of himſelf to him, and <hi>praiſes</hi> of <hi>aſſured</hi> ſouls are ſuch <hi>giving Duties,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) as do not only <hi>receive</hi> from God, but (in a ſort) <hi>beſtow</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p n="7">(7 Adde to this, that the very preſent <hi>comfort</hi> of <hi>communion with God</hi> (if there were no other advantage) to a gracious ſoul, were encouragement enough to Duty. How are the Saints of God wont to rejoyce, if God give them now and then a glance of his countenance? How, when they have not had communion with him for a while, do they complain, as if every day were a year, every year an Age? And is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of that communion ſo ſlight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that thou canſt now paſſe many dayes, it may be weeks, without any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affection of grief and trouble, at the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of intercourſe between thy ſoul and him? eſpecially when 'tis not through his ſtrangeneſſe, but through thine own.</p>
               <p n="8">(8 Conſider what <hi>this liberty</hi> of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God <hi>coſt Chriſt</hi> for thee. He laid down his deareſt bloud to bring thee ſo nigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Awake, my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Tongue, <hi>See you do your duty lively and vigorouſly, awake my Pſaltery, and I my ſelf wil awake early;</hi> i. e. <hi>I wil ſtir up all my graces to bear you company.</hi> And the whole Church complains of the want hereof, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5 God in all his grants takes ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>activity of our graces</hi> in approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Who is this that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his heart to approach to me, ſaith the Lord? q. d.</hi> There are <hi>many</hi> that approach to me, but who is that (among all the reſt) that <hi>engaged his heart</hi> to approach to me? Of <hi>all the reſt,</hi> I take notice of him, he <hi>quickned all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtirred up all his ſoul on purpoſe that he might approach to me.</hi> As if a <hi>great man</hi> come to a Town, and publick entertainment be made him; if any one among the reſt, be more <hi>active</hi> then ordinary, he takes eſpecial
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:170084:280"/> notice of him; <hi>Who is this that makes ſo much ado above all the reſt, I muſt take ſpecial notice of him, and gratifie him with ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favour.</hi> God lets paſſe an hundred lazy Petitioners, and ſeeks out a fervent one in a throng of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If <hi>you</hi> do not ſtir up your graces to ſeek God, <hi>God</hi> will ſtir them up for <hi>you.</hi> If an <hi>horſe</hi> that hath mettal enough grow <hi>dull,</hi> the rider puts to the <hi>spur</hi> to quicken him. If you grow <hi>dull and careleſs</hi> in Duty, God will <hi>spur up your graces,</hi> and quicken you to your pain, and coſt too. <hi>Indeed</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is it ſo? Can ſuch a man afford me no better ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then ſo? is every ſlight ſlovenly performance good enough for me? Well, I will be ſerved with that that coſts him ſomething before I have done with him. With-draw thy comforts from him</hi> (Spirit,) <hi>ſmite him</hi> (ſickneſs,) <hi>vex him</hi> (Satan,) <hi>perſecute him</hi> (enemies:) <hi>I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it I ſhall hear from him ſhortly in another guiſe manner.</hi> Hoſ. 5. 15. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early,</hi> Take this for an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rule; Ordinarily, after a <hi>continued deadneſs and formality</hi> of Spirit upon a Saint in Duty, comes ſome <hi>ſharp affliction</hi> or other.</p>

Meditate principally upon the moſt proper <hi>moving ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of every grace. <hi>Faith</hi> acts upon Gods <hi>(faithfulneſſe)</hi> in his promiſes; to ſtirre up <hi>faith</hi> (therefore) meditate upon God in his <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> and that, as declared in ſome ſpecial promiſe, that concerns thy caſe, and condition. <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>thankfulneſſe,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon the <hi>goodneſſe of God;</hi> Meditate upon the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of God to thee in particular, to ſtirre up thoſe graces; <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is moſt affected with a <hi>mans own vileneſſe</hi> and <hi>Gods glory</hi> compared together; here then, ſet out <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>majeſty,</hi> as gloriouſly as thou canſt, in thy meditations; then view thy <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and thy own <hi>vileneſſe,</hi> eſpecially
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:170084:281"/> reflecting upon thoſe ſinnes of thine, which have had moſt <hi>vileneſſe</hi> and <hi>loathſomneſſe</hi> of <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and are attended with the moſt <hi>abhominable aggravations.</hi> And ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces.</p>
               <p>2. Chooſe the moſt <hi>free and lively ſeaſons</hi> for duty. The <hi>morning,</hi> before worldly buſines hath deadned &amp; flatted the ſpirit, is of ſpecial uſe for prayer. 'Twas not for nothing that <hi>David</hi> ſo often made choyce of <hi>that time, Pſalm</hi> 5. 3. &amp; 59. 16. &amp; 88. 13. &amp; 119. 147. &amp; 63. 1. 108. 2. &amp;c. If a man will attend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny buſineſſe without diſtraction or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>time</hi> to be <hi>beforehand</hi> with the diſturbances of dayly buſineſſes, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. When we <hi>ſlip</hi> out of every <hi>worldly imployment</hi> into prayer, or at <hi>night</hi> when we are <hi>half aſleep,</hi> mix <hi>nods</hi> with <hi>petitions,</hi> no wonder if we complain of deadneſſe, and dulneſs and diſtraction.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Watch to prayer,</hi> Col. 4. 2. <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch thereunto, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 7. <hi>Be ſober and watch unto prayer. Watch</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Satan,</hi> who will then be buſie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe you, it may be with <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous thoughts</hi> and other ſuch diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſuggeſtions; and you then watch againſt him, when you ſet your heart againſt them, and turne your prayers edge againſt them, till you have caſt them out, and then returne to your duty again. Watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>your uſual careleſneſſe,</hi> and when you find it growing upon you, do likewiſe. <hi>Watch</hi>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:170084:281"/> againſt <hi>vain wandring thoughts,</hi> and throw them out by a ſpeedy laying hold upon ſome more <hi>weighty Meditation,</hi> if any ſuch be at hand: if not (but thou findeſt thy ſelf wholly poſſeſt with ſuch fancies) do as before I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, turn the <hi>edge of thy prayer</hi> for that while againſt them. <hi>Watch</hi> the <hi>kindlings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and where thou findeſt but one little <hi>ſpark</hi> of fervency and zeal, <hi>glowing,</hi> ply that Meditation, that Subject hard that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it. Follow the <hi>Veyne,</hi> and thou wilt be Maſter of the <hi>Mine</hi> at laſt.</p>
               <p>4 Be much in <hi>begging the Spirit of prayer,</hi> and calling him in to conſtant aſſiſtance in the Duty. Urge his <hi>Office</hi> upon him, he is a <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication.</hi> And to enliven and embolden the Saints is his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Reſt not in formes of Prayer.</hi> I do no way doubt but that a godly perſon newly brought in to the exerciſes of Religion, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſeek in expreſſing himſelf, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in ſuch a caſe (if a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Maſter of a Family) I am not ſo ſevere as to forbid him the uſe of a good form, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own or others framing: and in the cloſet it may be good to read now and then for example and pattern, the formes of others, but eſpecially the prayers of the <hi>Saints</hi> recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> (and among them the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which are (moſt of them) made up of matter of prayer, either in way of Confeſſion, Petition, or Thankſgiving)
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:170084:282"/> that they may ſuggeſt to us quickning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of prayer. Nay, whiles I read <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers form,</hi> wherein I meet with paſſages ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my condition, I know not why I may not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch Petitions: But yet I know not by what warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one in private, or <hi>conſtantly</hi> before others, binds himſelf to the very ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and frame of words. Nay, I think it is an Argument either of much <hi>lazineſſe,</hi> in not improving the utmoſt of a mans owne abilities and intereſts in the Spirit to enable him, or at leaſt it proceeds from a <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>erroneous conceit of God,</hi> as if he minded more an <hi>exact compoſure</hi> of Petitions, then the <hi>real</hi> (although <hi>immethodical,</hi> and <hi>leſſe quaintly dreſſed) deſires</hi> of a mans heart. The truth is, no man uſeth a <hi>form</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>much,</hi> but finds it (if hee know his owne heart) a great <hi>deadning, to his Spirit.</hi> If a <hi>Preacher</hi> ſhould twenty times in a year <hi>preach</hi> over the <hi>ſame Sermon,</hi> would not the veryeſt <hi>Formaliſts</hi> of his Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and indeed all others) ſleep and grow weary under ſuch preaching? And do we not ſee the ſame <hi>effects</hi> generally under a <hi>form of Prayer?</hi> or (at leaſt) is there not the ſame reaſon, why wee ſhould expect them? A perpetual uſe of the <hi>ſame form,</hi> is a more tedious <hi>tautology,</hi> then that which ſuch perſons often blame in <hi>conceived Prayer; viz.</hi> the repeating againe and againe the ſame Petitions in
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:170084:282"/> the <hi>ſame</hi> prayer. For <hi>this</hi> may proceed from <hi>fervency.</hi> See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 124. 4, 5. and 116. 14, 18. and 80. 3, 7, 19. The <hi>other</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, or begets <hi>lazineſſe;</hi> at leaſt it gives <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of it (and that not altogether cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) to others, which hath much of the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>No,</hi> by no meanes. But you muſt know that <hi>conceived</hi> Prayers, upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of a mans condition, or other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, are not the ſame with <hi>extempore</hi> prayers.</p>

               <p n="2">2 And (on the other ſide) a man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>very</hi> as occaſions vary, and yet not pray <hi>extempore,</hi> having before meditated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter of his Petitions, and layd up ſtore of furniture for prayer, though he truſt much to preſent gifts for <hi>expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> I cannot call this <hi>extemporary</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither yet is it unlawful (upon ſome occaſions, and in ſome caſes) to adventure upon this Duty <hi>extempore,</hi> both

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 (And laſtly) yet muſt we uſe this <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> very tenderly and ſuſpiciouſly, leſt our hearts perſwade us that there is a greater frequency of ſuch occaſions then there is, and ſo it prove a ſnare to us (when we find (it may be) <hi>more then ordinary abilityes,</hi> without <hi>ordinary endeavors;</hi> as ſomtimes when God calls to <hi>ſudden</hi> ſervice, he gives in <hi>ſudden</hi> ſupplies) we may be tempted to expect the <hi>ſame abilities</hi> in the <hi>ſame way,</hi> without the <hi>ſame call.</hi> We muſt <hi>not tempt the Lord our God.</hi> And that is done (one way) when we expect <hi>extraordinary</hi> ſupplies from him in the neglect of the <hi>ordinary</hi> way appointed by <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 7.</note> him for the attainment of them.</p>

               <p>I ſay in this caſe.</p>
               <p>[1.] Thou muſt <hi>look upon it as a duty,</hi> ſo grounded, as before, and <hi>ſuch</hi> a duty as God is <hi>exceedingly delighted</hi> withall: and ſo ſtrive to break the bonds of <hi>ſinfull modeſty.</hi> There is a <hi>ſinfull</hi> modeſty, which the very <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> condemne as a <hi>vice in morality,</hi> and call it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This is an <hi>infirmity,</hi> even in Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They come to God many times in Duty, as if they were doing that that they are <hi>aſhamed</hi> to bee ſeen in, and are afraid of being <hi>taken in the fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they muſt labour exceedingly againſt as an infirmity, and often remember that they offend againſt an expreſly commanded Duty, if they <hi>come</hi> not <hi>boldly to the Throne of grace.</hi>

               <p>2.

               <p>3.

Now ſurely this nearneſſe of union between God and our nature, cannot but infer the moſt entire <hi>friendſhip,</hi> and by
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:170084:290"/> conſequence the moſt full <hi>communion</hi> that can be. And as by the relation that wee have to his <hi>humane nature,</hi> now marryed to the divine, we are emboldened by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>our</hi> fleſh to come to Chriſt, and he by the relation of <hi>his</hi> fleſh bound to ſympathize with us; ſo by the relation that <hi>his fleſh</hi> in this union hath to <hi>God</hi> the Father, we may come to God the Father too, with aſſurance that this <hi>marriage into our kindred,</hi> muſt needs derive ſome more particular reſpect unto his <hi>family,</hi> and <hi>humane relations.</hi> And to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thee to this, I add, that no <hi>natural relation,</hi> that he had in the World, <hi>(as</hi> ſuch) would be more prevalent with him, then thou, if thou be of his <hi>family by faith.</hi> No, not his very <hi>mother according to the fleſh;</hi> ſo that were I of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> mind, for <hi>praying to Saints</hi> to intercede for me to Chriſt, I ſhould as boldly uſe <hi>any</hi> of the glorified Saints as <hi>her</hi> mediation; and if ſhe were on earth, if <hi>ſhe</hi> prayed in her <hi>ſonnes</hi> name, ſhe had no more advantage by the relation of a <hi>mother</hi> to his <hi>natural</hi> body, then another Saint by the relation of a member of his <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> body. For as Chriſt received not his <hi>perſon</hi> from the virgin, but his <hi>nature,</hi> ſo hee cannot be affected with any ſuch <hi>perſonal</hi> reſpects as we are: but <hi>whoever doth the Will of his Father,</hi> (as himſelf ſaith, when his <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>brethren</hi> came upon the account of relation to call him off from a work that concerned the ſpiritual good of other Saints)

It may be, you may conceive if you had a <hi>natural relation</hi> to Chriſt, you might be more bold with his name to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of any thing from God. I tell you again, the <hi>meaneſt woman</hi> here, upon Chriſts account may aske as boldly, as the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> might: becauſe the union between God and man in Chriſt is not ſuch an union in which he aſſumed a humane <hi>perſon,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an humane <hi>nature.</hi>

               <p>(2 <hi>Remember whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works.</hi> Remove the obſtacle (as was directed above in the caſe of loſt Aſſurance) and then thou maiſt <hi>renew</hi> thy confidence.</p>
               <p>(3 Practiſe all the <hi>Helps</hi> to the <hi>recovering</hi> of this holy confidence when it is loſt, which are above preſcribed to the <hi>attainment</hi> of it at the firſt. <hi>Look on it as a Duty, fortifie againſt the forementioned diſcouragements, ſtudy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, renew thy apprehenſions of God in Chriſt, come with a due pre-conſideration of thy wants, and the exigencies of them.</hi>

               <p>(4 To theſe add,</p>
               <p>1 <hi>An holy expoſtulation with God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing former familiarities.</hi> Mind the Lord of the acquaintance that <hi>hath been</hi> between him and thy ſoul, intreat him to continue it; <hi>Lord, where are thy ancient loving kindneſſes? How many hours have I ſpent in familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of love between thee and my ſoul</hi> I <hi>but Lord, now thou art a ſtranger to me, and there paſſeth little of common courteſie between us.

               </p>
               <p>3 In the <hi>manner</hi> of prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A Saint may ſpeak to God in <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right plain language,</hi> as to a friend.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 God accepts of <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>broken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> when we can ſpeak no better; <hi>liſpings</hi> and <hi>stutterings</hi> of children are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to a <hi>Father,</hi> when (through infirmity) the <hi>child</hi> is able to ſpeak no better. <hi>Davids groaning,</hi> Pſal. 38. 9. <hi>Hezekiahs chattering, Iſai.</hi> 38. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A Saint may uſe <hi>fervency, urgency, and importunity of petitions.</hi> So <hi>Jacob, Lord, I wil not let thee go, except thou bleſſe me</hi> Gen. 32. 26. As a man who may be bold with his friend, takes him by the <hi>coat</hi> when he is departing, &amp; holds him faſt, and tells him in a way of <hi>familiar power and juriſdiction,</hi> (as it were) <hi>Sir, you ſhall not go hence to night,</hi> &amp;c. So in the caſe
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:170084:294"/> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God is fain, as a friend detained by ſuch an <hi>importunate inviter,</hi> (as is before mentioned) to intreat <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>let him go, Exod.</hi> 32. 10. This is expreſt by our Savior by an elegant ſimilitude, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 5, 6, 7. 8. of one friends importunity with another at <hi>midnight,</hi> an unſeaſonable hour, and <hi>when the friend is in bed at reſt,</hi> &amp;c. So the Saints uſe to <hi>knock,</hi> and if knocks will not make God hear, they <hi>call, Where is the God of Eliah?</hi> 2 Kings 2. 14. if God ſeem to <hi>ſleep,</hi> they <hi>awaken</hi> him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 23. <hi>Give the Lord no rest,</hi> Iſai. 62. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4 A Saint may have <hi>confidence of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and acceptance.</hi> Hebr. 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw nigh,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1 This appears in the Saints <hi>beſetting of God with promiſes,</hi> that God cannot any way get off, if he would ſeem to deny them.

                  </note> (2) A Saints <hi>fear of God in prayer,</hi> conſiſts,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that <hi>conſcience of Duty</hi> that brings him into the preſence of God, if there were <hi>nothing elſe</hi> to move him thereunto; though he had <hi>no need,</hi> though there were <hi>no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> to the neglect of it, no <hi>promiſes</hi> to the performance of it, yet becauſe <hi>God requires</hi> it, he dares not neglect it. This is that <hi>fear</hi> that God requires as a <hi>maſter,</hi> of all his people as <hi>ſervants.</hi> Now we muſt know that all <hi>fear of God</hi> as a <hi>maſter,</hi> that is, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience out of conſcience of duty, is not <hi>ſervile fear;</hi> but then 'tis <hi>ſervile,</hi> when it is not ſo much out of conſcience of <hi>duty,</hi> as out of conſcience of <hi>wrath</hi> or <hi>puniſhment</hi> upon neglect. A <hi>child</hi> is a Fathers <hi>ſervant,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes him as <hi>ſuch;</hi> yet obeys not <hi>ſervilely.</hi> Therefore God calls for this fear, upon this account. If I be a <hi>maſter, where is my fear?</hi> that is, <hi>dutifull obedience to my commands?</hi> Mal. 1. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>matter</hi> of our performances, it is a <hi>diligent care of what we offer to God,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:170084:295"/> the ſoul from offering <hi>ſtange fire,</hi> boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a mans deſires with the <hi>will of God.</hi> A <hi>fear,</hi> leſt any thing ſhould ſlip from a mans mouth or heart, that is diſpleaſing to God. As a <hi>child,</hi> though he may <hi>make bold</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> yet is carefull not to aske any thing of his Father, that he knows will <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe</hi> him: ſo in this, a Saint takes care that all his petitions be <hi>warranted by a rule, and encouraged by a promiſe,</hi> and beyond theſe he dares not <hi>wiſh,</hi> much leſſe, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of God to <hi>aske</hi> any thing. He dares not <hi>tempt God,</hi> by depending on him for, or deſiring at his hands what his word doth not warrant.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſuch a <hi>fear</hi> as diſcourageth the ſoul in asking ſuch things as a man hath <hi>warrant</hi> to deſire. So farre as the <hi>promiſe</hi> goes, a ſoul dares ask, elſe 'tis not a <hi>child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> but a <hi>childiſh fear;</hi> not the fear of a <hi>Courtier,</hi> but the fear of a <hi>clown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>manner</hi> of performing ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: it is a <hi>deportment of the ſoul with that reverence as becomes the greatneſſe and glory of God compared with our own baſeneſſe,</hi> and <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> and <hi>jealouſie of our own hearts, lest we ſhould do any thing unbeſeeming ſuch a God or ſuch a</hi> duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No ſoul hath more <hi>reverend</hi> and <hi>high</hi> thoughts of God, then ſuch a ſoul as hath <hi>moſt right to holy confidence</hi> in his preſence. The more <hi>acquaintance</hi> with God, the more of this <hi>fear.</hi> None waits upon a <hi>Prince</hi> with
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:170084:295"/> more reverence and obſervance, then the greateſt <hi>favourites,</hi> the ordinary and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Courtiers:</hi> A man that comes out of the <hi>Country,</hi> and is not acquainted with <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> is not ſo obſervant of every <hi>punctilio of ceremony,</hi> as thoſe that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually about the <hi>Prince.</hi> This it is, that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>(Pſ.</hi> 89. 7.) <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence of all that are round about him.</hi> Gods greateſt <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> are moſt <hi>obſervant</hi> of him. The more we converſe with God, the more wee know what <hi>becomes</hi> his glory, and majeſty; and all <hi>irreverence</hi> proceeds from <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> from want of <hi>converſe</hi> with God. A <hi>country man</hi> reverences a <hi>Prince,</hi> no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he doth his <hi>landlord,</hi> becauſe he is not converſant in the <hi>Court,</hi> and obſerves not the <hi>ſtate,</hi> and <hi>ceremony,</hi> kept and uſed there. The <hi>Seraphims</hi> that are the conſtant <hi>Courtiers</hi> of heaven, they <hi>cover their faces</hi> with a fear of awe and reverence, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None is more <hi>watchfull over his own heart in the manner of a performance,</hi> then a Saint, that hath moſt grounds of <hi>boldneſſe and confidence</hi> in the preſence of God. He dares not run <hi>raſhly</hi> into Gods preſence, and if but a <hi>low, mean thought of God</hi> ariſe, how doth his heart riſe againſt it? If but a <hi>ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thought</hi> carry him off from his buſineſſe, how doth he ſend out <hi>poſt</hi> after it, and call it
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:170084:296"/> in again? This is a fear of <hi>jealouſie,</hi> This is called <hi>watching to prayer</hi> (of which above,) <note place="margin">

               <head>CHAP. LVI. Some comfortable informations from this Theſis and (for an upſhot) a Caſe how I ſhall know whether my actual fervency and boldneſſe bee from Gods Spirit, or Satan, or any natural principle, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THis affords matter of <hi>abundant comfort</hi> to all who have this <hi>boldneſſe and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,</hi> from the operation of this witneſſing Spirit in prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>work it ſelf.</hi> Certainly it is a ſweet thing to be able <hi>in all things to make</hi> a mans <hi>requeſts known to God,</hi> with confidence. How incomparable an eaſe is it to a man to have a <hi>boſome-friend,</hi> and him ſuch a one, as is able not only to hear, but hear, and help to make of ones counſell in the weightieſt, and moſt important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in the greateſt, and moſt unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table burthens! eſpecially, to a <hi>child</hi> to have ſuch a <hi>father.</hi> This is the happineſſe aſcribed to the <hi>Jews</hi> above all other <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> meerly upon the account of an outward propriety, a viſible, Church propriety, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:170084:297"/> liberty of approach. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>to have</hi> God ſo nigh to <hi>them in all that they called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>riſe of it.</hi> This is a main work of the <hi>Spirit of Adoption.</hi> You are arrived <hi>as high</hi> in point of communion with God, as you can poſſibly in this <hi>ſtate of diſtance.</hi> The <hi>witneſſe</hi> of the Spirit is our moſt comfortable <hi>enjoyment,</hi> and the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>prayſes</hi> that proceed from it, our moſt comfortable <hi>employment</hi> that we are capable of here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And the comfort of it lies in this, that it is an act of influence from the Spirit of the moſt noble, and heavenly nature of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; 'tis an evidence of a large and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant meaſure of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Iſſue of it,</hi> what may not ſuch an one do with God? But that the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>miraculous works</hi> is ceaſed, and ſo 'tis a tempting God to put him needleſſely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary expences, ſurely (I may ſay) ſuch an one might (as our Saviour ſaith) <hi>ſay to this or that mountain, be thou plucked up by the roots, and caſt into the depth of the Sea,</hi> and that with aſſurance of ſucceſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20. &amp; 21. 22. Now if this be true of the leaſt degree and meaſure of faith (though but <hi>reliance)</hi> as it is, much more undoubtedly of <hi>acts of aſſurance,</hi> and ſuch an one is this ſpiritual boldneſſe and confidence in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Qu.</label> But how ſhall I <hi>know</hi> whether my <hi>fervency</hi> and <hi>boldneſſe of ſpirit</hi> in prayer,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:170084:298"/> come from <hi>Gods Spirit of Adoption,</hi> or <hi>mine own ſpirit,</hi> or (poſſibly) <hi>Satans ſpirit of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> This queſtion is weighty, and I muſt anſwer diſtinctly to both parts.</p>
               <p>(1.) For <hi>fervency,</hi> it is true,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometime 'tis but <hi>natural. Great wants</hi> produce <hi>earnest intreaties.</hi> Beggers ready to ſtarve begge in earneſt. <hi>Terrours</hi> of God and <hi>frights</hi> of conſcience many times make fervent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes it may alſo be the work of a <hi>deluding and preſtigious</hi> ſpirit, who I know not why he may not counterfeit the Spirit of prayer in this operation, as well as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace in many others.</p>
               <p>But 3. The diſcovery of the difference lies in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>(1.) In the <hi>nature of this fervency,</hi> and that conſiſts in theſe things.</p>
               <p>1. In the <hi>lively actings of all our graces</hi> in prayer. This I have ſhewed you before, is the courſe of Gods Saints to ſtirre up <hi>all within</hi> them to the performance of the duty. The <hi>bow</hi> that is ſerviceable muſt bee <hi>bent</hi> in all parts alike, elſe it will faile the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Archer.</hi> A <hi>counterfeit</hi> fervency or a meer <hi>natural</hi> fervency is <hi>partial. Deſire,</hi> may ſeem to be fervent in prayer, but <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow for ſinne,</hi> and <hi>thankfulneſſe,</hi> are cold. Many a man <hi>askes</hi> what he <hi>wants</hi> with great earneſtneſſe, but <hi>confeſſeth ſinne,</hi> and <hi>gives thanks</hi> for mercies received, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially.
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:170084:298"/> This puts a great ſuſpicion upon the Duty.</p>
               <p>2. In a <hi>zealous watchfulneſs over a mans heart</hi> againſt all thoſe things that may <hi>coole, deaden or diſtract</hi> it. And thus a gracious ſoul is not only then fervent, when (it may be) a <hi>landfloud</hi> of affections <hi>drownes</hi> (for the preſent) the actings of <hi>formality, wandring thoughts:</hi> &amp;c. but even when theſe are <hi>moſt ſtirring,</hi> it ſhews its fervency by <hi>labouring,</hi> and <hi>wrestling</hi> againſt them: Another may be fervent <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> upon ſuch or ſuch a particular <hi>impreſſion</hi> of ſpirit, (as ſuppoſe in the ſenſe of ſome <hi>imminent danger,</hi> ſome <hi>extraordinary conviction)</hi> but hee doth not keep his watch, or ſtand ſo upon his guard, as to <hi>preſerve himſelfe in that temper,</hi> but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to decline into <hi>formality,</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> again as ſoon as that impreſſion is a little layd by the <hi>vent</hi> it finds in a Duty.</p>
               <p>(2.) In the <hi>matter wherein</hi> one is fervent. A man may be fervent in ſuch things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his own <hi>preſent neceſſity,</hi> Iſai. 26. 16. <hi>They powred out a prayer, when thy chaſtening</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>was upon them, [effuderunt</hi> or <hi>liquefecerunt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem]</hi> they ſeemed to be <hi>meltingly fluent,</hi> as <hi>mettal when it runs by the force of fire; but</hi> that is a <hi>fervency</hi> that holds no longer then the fire laſts. In thoſe things that concerne the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and are more <hi>remote from a mans private concernment,</hi> there is more cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and indifferency. In petitions for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, much heat; little in petitions for <hi>grace</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="580" facs="tcp:170084:299"/>
               <p>(3) In the <hi>concomitants of this fervency.</hi> It doth beget a ſutable frame of ſpirit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>all places.</hi> Many an one is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearingly fervent when hee prayes <hi>before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> But is there the ſame heat in <hi>private,</hi> or rather, are our <hi>private cloſet prayers</hi> cold and formal? <hi>Satans</hi> ſpirit, a ſpirit of <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,</hi> &amp;c. may make a man fervent before others; but the Spirit of God only ſupplies a private fervency; to wreſtle with God in private (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did by night) and alone, is likely to be gracious fervency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>all duties.</hi> A man that hath a <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heat</hi> of affections in prayer will not bee without ſome impreſsions of it in <hi>other duties.</hi> In the hearing of the <hi>word,</hi> a mans <hi>heart</hi> will <hi>burne, Luke</hi> 24. 32. In his <hi>place</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> there will be a zealous <hi>endeavour</hi> to do <hi>good,</hi> a zealous <hi>anger</hi> againſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> a zealous <hi>grief</hi> for <hi>ſin.</hi> This is ſeen in <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 119. 32. 139. &amp; 102 <hi>Pſ.</hi> throughout: a zealous and fervent love to all the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <p>4. In the <hi>riſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) It is <hi>gotten</hi> in the Saints by <hi>induſtry, kindled</hi> by <hi>meditation,</hi> and moſt commonly they know how they come by it, how much <hi>ado</hi> it coſts them to raiſe their heart to ſuch a pitch. When fervency of ſpirit comes in, with a groſſe <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>quickening endeavours,</hi> its ſuſpicious. <hi>Not</hi> that a child of God may not now and then find an <hi>heat kindled</hi> in prayer, which he can <hi>give no account of.</hi> But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeeks and labours for it in the regular way.</p>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:170084:299"/>
               <p>(2.) It is grounded on a <hi>promiſe.</hi> A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man ſeldome eyes a <hi>promiſe,</hi> but his <hi>wants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Ob.</label> Yea, but I can draw no comfort from this, becauſe all this concernes ſuch as have the Spirit of Adoption in its <hi>witneſſing work.</hi> In me that have it <hi>not,</hi> it may be ſtil a fervency of a <hi>natural impreſſion,</hi> from meere <hi>neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>ſenſe of want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> 'Tis true, that this work eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeds from the Spirit of Adoption in its <hi>witneſſing Act:</hi> but it <hi>alſo</hi> proceeds from the Spirit of Adoption in its <hi>renewing Act.</hi> The Spirit is a <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> not only as a Spirit of <hi>conſolation,</hi> but alſo as a <hi>Spirit of grace Ze.</hi> 12. 10. And therefore although ſuch perſons, who have the witneſſe of the Spirit may take comfort in ſeeing this fruit of it; yet we muſt not think that there is <hi>no ſuch fruit,</hi> where there is not ſuch a witneſſe. And therefore if thou find this fervency that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove deſcribed in thy heart (if it do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the Spirit (as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may, from its more <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>remiſs</hi> Teſtimony (of which I have ſpoken before) although thou doſt not <hi>know,</hi> or at leaſt not for the preſent <hi>obſerve it;)</hi> yet) it always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that Spirit that is in all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the Spirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ſo qualified as is ſaid. Indeed that that is moſt <hi>ſenſible</hi> in the fervency of an <hi>unaſsured</hi> ſoul is <hi>ſenſe of want.</hi> But they may alſo <hi>obſerve</hi> in themſelvs, that they are not fervent <hi>only</hi> in
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:170084:300"/> ſuch things; (at leaſt) that they labour for it in other things.</p>
               <p>(2.) As for <hi>boldneſs</hi> in duty, 1. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed you wherein. it conſiſts, and how it joynes with fear. And that which is not of the <hi>right ſtamp</hi> commonly failes in one of the forementioned particulars; it is a boldneſſe that allowes a man as much to <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> as <hi>performe</hi> duty; <hi>that tempts God</hi> by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning and expecting what is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, or at leaſt not in his way, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall ſhut up this Treatiſe, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſiring that God will give all that read it experience of theſe works, that they may be able to ſeal to the truth of it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Making promiſes</hi> to this duty rightly performed in ſuch a ſeaſon. See at large, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 13, 14, &amp; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. 15.</p>

               <p>Now God <hi>calls</hi> not for, <hi>expects</hi> not, <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth</hi> not, <hi>proſpers</hi> not an unſeaſonable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore from all this it followes, that to one that looks on God in affliction, the ſeaſonableneſſe of prayer is ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:170084:307"/> by all theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>(2) Look on <hi>our ſelves</hi> under affliction, and prayer will ſeem exceeding ſeaſonable at ſuch a time, from theſe following conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ariſing from <hi>the condition it ſelfe</hi> which we are under; which hath theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in its nature, and uſual attendants to further us in the duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Senſe of pain</hi> or <hi>preſent danger.</hi> 'Tis natural to cry under the rod, <hi>qui neſcit orare,</hi> &amp;c. (ſaith the proverb,) <hi>ſend a man to Sea, if you'l teach him to pray. Jonah</hi> 1. 6. Even hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Marriners can find ſome God or other to go to in a ſtorme, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 6. I know, 'tis not alwayes <hi>gracious</hi> prayer that comes from a ſenſe of ſuffering. A <hi>dogge</hi> will <hi>howle</hi> when you ſtrike him; and God can give ſome mens devotions in ſuch a condition no better terme, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. But I know alſo that even a <hi>child</hi> will cry, and begge heartily under the rod. And all prayers that are extorted from men by ſmart, are not carnal and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prayers, though ſometimes (and in wicked men alwayes) they be ſo. The <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> may be ſpiritual, though the <hi>motive</hi> be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. We <hi>faſt,</hi> and the Jews and others of old, wore <hi>ſackcloth</hi> upon their fleſh, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke by the hunger and pain of the body the ſpirits to devotion. When the <hi>ſpirit is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed,</hi> the natural man ſeeks vent <hi>ſometimes</hi> this way, but a godly man <hi>alwayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Affliction uſually begets <hi>lowly and humble thoughts</hi> in men. For as it is natural
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:170084:308"/> to man to be proud and lofty under a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 5, 6. So is it alſo to begin to know himſelf when he is laid low by affliction, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Put them in fear O Lord, that the nations may know themſelves to be but men.</hi> Before they ſcarce thought they were men, as others are, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 27, 28, 29. Long afflictions (ſuch as the Prophet deſcribes there) make men <hi>ſit alone, and keep ſilence, lay their very mouthes in the very dust,</hi> and take patiently any thing from God or men. I know that a man may be <hi>humbled,</hi> that is not <hi>humble.</hi> No afflictions, though they plow <hi>long furrowes,</hi> and deep ones too, can of themſelves teare up the <hi>root of pride</hi> out of the heart; but they may tear and mangle it ſo, that it may be checked for the preſent in its growth, whiles better ſeeds are ſown in the heart by grace, that in time will wafte it quite out of the field. Wicked men will never pray, till affliction bring them upon their knees. And the Saints of God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are too proud to be beholden to God till bare need force them to it. The <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> whiles he had but <hi>husks</hi> (though a ſonne) yet thinks not of his duty. And 'tis ſaid of our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe, that (as man) he <hi>learned obedience by the things that he ſuffered. Heb.</hi> 5. 8. and being <hi>a man of ſorrowes,</hi> in his ſtate of humiliation, he <hi>powred out ſtrong cryes and groanes,</hi> v. 7. Now that which (grace cooperating with it) humbles and layes the ſoul low before God, puts a man into the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt temper for prayer.</p>
               <pb n="597" facs="tcp:170084:308"/>
               <p n="3">3. Afflictions (ordinarily) are, the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingdiſh</hi> that warmes, and recovers the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſinne</hi> unto men.</p>
               <p>They recovered the remembrance of the Patriarchs ſinne (as Divines obſerve) twenty years after, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. <hi>Now verily</hi> (ſay they) now we are in bonds, <hi>are we guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Brother, (i. e.)</hi> now our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences tell us we are guilty. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>I will returne to my place, till they be guilty,</hi> i. e. till the ſenſe of guilt forgotten, afreſh ſeize their conſciences: therefore <hi>Job</hi> calls plagues, Gods <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and renewed plagues, <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed witneſſes,</hi> Job 10 17. becauſe they teſtify ſinne, and oftentimes (when they are repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted plagues) wilfulneſſe, and obſtinacy in ſinne. And this property of affliction makes it very much conduce to prayer. A burden: ed ſpirit under ſenſe of ſinne, vents its ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and oppreſſions that way. Prayer to ſuch a ſoul, is like <hi>lightening</hi> the <hi>ſhip</hi> in a <hi>ſtorm</hi> like <hi>letting out</hi> the impoſtumed <hi>matter</hi> out of a ſore. As ſhall be ſhewn more hereafter.</p>

Jer.</hi> 4. 19. And towards <hi>Ephraim</hi> in affliction, ſee what part of God is moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. <hi>My [bowels] are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for him.</hi> Therefore the Church in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is expert in this Argument. <hi>Where is thy zeale, and thy ſtrength, the ſounding of thy [bowels] and of thy mercies towards me? Iſai.</hi> 63. 15.</p>
               <p>And God delights exceedingly to ſhew his pity, and his tender mercies to his people in ſuch a time; he is <hi>a God that delighteth in mercy. Micah.</hi> 7. 18. and therefore delights to be urged with it, and to have it pleaded in a time of miſery. And for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he maketh our greateſt miſery and moſt forlorne condition, a <hi>time of love</hi> and mercy. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 136. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 48.

                  <pb n="601" facs="tcp:170084:310"/> the proper <hi>object</hi> of mercy, and the <hi>correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of it. This is a good argument to plead with God, <hi>Lord, now I am a fit object of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: thou art a God of tender mercies, and thy compaſſions faile not. If ever any ſoul needed tender mercies, I am that ſoul: Behold, Lord, my affliction; ſee Lord, and conſider, behold Lord and conſider, remember O Lord what is come upon us, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Church often in the <hi>Lamentations, Lam.</hi> 1. 9, 20. &amp; 2. 20. &amp; 3. 1.

A <hi>beggar</hi> that hath a <hi>maim,</hi> a <hi>ſouldier</hi> that hath the <hi>ſcarres</hi> of his dangerous wounds to ſhew, hath a great advantage in begging, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thoſe ordinary beggars that can ſhew no ſuch arguments and inducements to pity. Miſery <hi>ſpeaks aloud,</hi> when he that ſuffers it, it may be, hath not a <hi>tongue</hi> to utter it.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>ſeaſonableneſſe of relief,</hi> in ſuch a time, may bee a prevailing motive. Gods ſeaſon of mercy and pity, is our depth of want and miſery: relief in ſuch a condition divers times is <hi>double relief:</hi> When God helps an <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the <hi>mount,</hi> when he ſteps in between a man and the very <hi>brink</hi> of danger, this endears a mercy. Now when a man can plead with God thus, <hi>Lord, thou haſt made me hear much of thy mercy, pity, and bounty; Lord, if ever thou wilt give me an</hi>

                  <hi>experiment of it, now is a fit time to do it, now I am at a loſſe every way elſe, now I am at the very brink of deſpaire. O what a ſeaſon mayeſt thou now take to engage my heart unto thee!</hi> As it is prevalent with a friend to urge, Sir <hi>You have often bid me make uſe of you, you have promiſed me many times what you would do for me; now Sir, if you will ever relieve me, now is the time when you may do me a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging kindneſſe.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> prayes <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69. 13. <hi>My prayer</hi> is unto thee O Lord, in <hi>an acceptable time,</hi> ſave me; now deliverance will be welcome, So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 143. 7.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>preſent hindrance</hi> that a man finds <hi>in the ſervice of God,</hi> by an affliction, is of much importance (by way of Argument) in ſuch a ſeaſon. For Gods main inducement in all that he doth, is <hi>his own glory.</hi> And 'tis a great diſcovery of a gracious ſpirit, when a man deſires not his own <hi>eaſe</hi> ſo much as Gods <hi>glory;</hi> nor his own eaſe, but for, and in ſubſervience unto Gods glory; in ſuch petitions there is much <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch petitions pleaſe God moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe kinds of pleas are very uſuall in the Saints and ſervants of God through all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>In death</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee, in the grave who ſhall give thee thanks? Pſalm</hi> 6. 5, <hi>And what profit is there in my bloud, when I go down to the pit? ſhall the duſt praiſe thee? Pſalm</hi> 30. 9. And <hi>Heman, Pſalm</hi> 88. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead, &amp;c. ſhall thy wonders bee</hi>

When I can aske <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency</hi> of eſtate, not to <hi>ſpend on my luſts,</hi> but to glorifie God, benefit the Church, refreſh the bowels of the Saints; and that in <hi>pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> grieves us moſt, that we cannot do ſo; to tell God ſo in prayer, how ſucceſſefull is it likely to be? When in <hi>ſpiritual deſertion</hi> I can ſay, <hi>Lord, I want a frame of ſpirit fit to glorifie thee, I cannot pray, read, hear, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, without wofull diſtractions; I diſhonour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by drooping, &amp;c. therefore lift up the light of thy countenance upon me, that I may ſpeak great things of thy name, that I may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thee,</hi> Pſalm 51. 12. 13, 14, 15. &amp; 142. 7. This Argument alſo affliction ſuppeditates.</p>

It's true, thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe needeth no ſuch avouchers; but my faith, and that of others, needs ſuch props: many of thy people will be much refreſhed by what thou ſhalt do for me; I will tell them what God hath done for my ſoul. Set me up as a patterne of mercy, and tender compaſſions to them that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall believe:</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 16.

               <p>Now, it is true (in the laſt place) none of theſe arguments work any alteration of <hi>God,</hi> (who is the ſame before we aske as when we aske; and becauſe he intends to give, fits and frames our hearts to aske) but it is much <hi>to us,</hi> when in prayer we can urge ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as may ſupport our faith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an anſwer: God is not the more diſpoſed to give by ſuch arguments,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:170084:312"/> but we are made more inclinable to believe we ſhall receive upon ſuch conſiderations; and by ſo believing, more diſpoſed and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the mercies we begge at his hands.

               <p>Whereas (on the other ſide) when bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of ſpirit have <hi>vent,</hi> that a man can diſcharge them freely in prayer, they are much allayed. Prayer is an <hi>exerciſe</hi> that warmes a man into an holy ſweat, by which he ſweetly <hi>breaths out</hi> the malady that vexed
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:170084:313"/> him. If a man have but a faithfull <hi>friend,</hi> that will ſuffer him (under any preſſure) to ſit down by his ſide, and patiently tell him the ſad ſtories of his preſſures, what a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it? But to ſee how a <hi>child</hi> that hath gotten a grievous fall, if he can but go to the father and ſhew him the wound, and complain of the miſchance; if the father will take up the child in his armes, and blow upon the part, it is well preſently! How much more will prayer eaſe an oppreſſed ſpirt by recourſe to God, who is more <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> then a thouſand friends, and more <hi>fatherly</hi> then a thouſand Fathers? His bowels are beyond thoſe of the tenderer ſex, whoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and compaſſion is commonly moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, (as <hi>Jonathans)</hi> beyond the <hi>love of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 26. and thoſe of the tendereſt relation in that Sex. <hi>Can a woman, a mother, forget her ſucking child? &amp;c. Yet will I not forget thee,</hi> Iſai. 49. 15.</p>
               <p>2 'Tis a courſe that will mightily <hi>lay the diſtempers of our own ſpirits,</hi> which (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) are the bellowes that blow every ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a flame, and make it a <hi>devouring</hi> fire, that ſhould be but a <hi>refining</hi> one. A mans <hi>heart</hi> in an affliction, is like the <hi>ſea</hi> in a <hi>tempeſt,</hi> and (as that) diſturbs it ſelf, and toſſeth it ſelf up and down in unquiet moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one thought (as ſo many waves) daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pieces another; it ſpares no body, falls out with men, quarrels with meer ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe inſtruments, occaſions and providences,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:170084:313"/> takes pet at God himſelfe, and how many thouſands more mad pranks of paſſion and diſcontent doth it play in ſuch a condition? What a frantick, bedlam-frame (for the while) was that of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, in his fit of impatience? To <hi>curſe the day of his birth,</hi> Alas, that day was paſt many years before, and never to return again, a meer non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; he might with as much diſcretion have curſed <hi>latter Lammas</hi> (as we uſe to ſay) a day that ſhall never be; as the day that is paſt, and can be recalled no more. Then he falls out with the <hi>knees that dandled him, and the breſts that nouriſhed him,</hi> his <hi>mother,</hi> or (if we can imagine that the faſhion of putting out children to nurſe was then brought into the world) his <hi>Nurſe.</hi> This was a worſe diſtemper, an unnatural rage againſt thoſe to whom he owed moſt love. And a while after he falls out with God, and will needs reaſon the caſe with him. Like a mad man in a throng, he deals blowes about him, and cares not (or at leaſt conſiders not) where they light, on friend or foe. But when God once brings us down upon our knees, O what a calme is there? How ſoon doth the Soveraignty of God, the holineſſe, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, wiſdome of God, compared with our dependent condition, our baſeneſſe, guilt, folly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (ſet before the eyes of the ſoul when it is powred out in prayer) make us tame and meek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſelf-reſigning and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Inſtruments, even <hi>bleſſing them that</hi>

               <p>And 'tis a ſpecial mercy of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in prayer, that we become thereby, ſo far <hi>Maſters of our ſelves.</hi> And ſo much the greater, becauſe it is the greateſt miſery in the world to be torn to pieces (as <hi>Actoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the Poet) by a mans <hi>own kennel</hi> of unmortified paſſions; to bee condemned to <hi>eat up and devour a mans ſelf,</hi> becauſe he cannot better his <hi>own</hi> condition, or hurt <hi>others;</hi> to <hi>gnaw a flint,</hi> whence a man can get nothing but <hi>broken teeth;</hi> and (in a word) to <hi>adde affliction</hi> to a mans <hi>affliction,</hi> by acting <gap reason="foreign">

See it in <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 14, 15. <hi>Deliver me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from blouds O Lord; then my tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy righteouſneſſe. Open my mouth, &amp;c. Davids</hi> lips had a <hi>padlock</hi> upon them, guilt had locked them up: He dared not ſpeak to God, whom he had ſo grievouſly offended. And no wonder, if Saints dare not <hi>ſpeak</hi> where they are ſure not to <hi>ſpeed;</hi> if they be <hi>dumb</hi> when they know God is <hi>deaf. David</hi> knew well enough, that ſinnes make <hi>Gods ear heavy,</hi> as he informes us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66. 18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer?</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us no leſſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. 1, 2. The Spirit of prayer alſo will be grieved, and depart from us, if we defile his lodging; he is a pure, an holy Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, the counſel of <hi>Zophar</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> 11. 13, 14. is very good. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thy hands towards God, If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So ſhalt thou lift up thy face [confidently]</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Search out the ſinne and remove it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>repentance,</hi> and the freſh application of the bloud of Chriſt by <hi>faith</hi> (which is the
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:170084:322"/> fountain of Evangelical repentance) and then try again; <hi>the Spirit of Grace</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables thee to mourne, will bee a <hi>Spirit of Supplication</hi> too, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
               <p>(3.) Sometimes <hi>Gods glory</hi> is the cauſe of thy reſtaints of ſpirit, God intending to teach thee that all thy enlargements are <hi>from him alone:</hi> We often pray in the ſtrength of <hi>natural parts, or gifts,</hi> at the beſt; and it may be we idolize theſe laſt in our ſelves and others. Now God may (in his wiſedome) leave us to ſtraightenedneſſe of ſpirit in prayer, to make us leſſe depending upon thoſe helps And this he <hi>will</hi> do (to chooſe) at ſuch a <hi>time,</hi> when <hi>afflictions</hi> are heavy upon us; becauſe that is a time (if any be) when it may be ſuppoſed, <hi>neceſſity will enlarge parts and gifts</hi> to the utmoſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are uſually incitements, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of enlargement in prayer. God makes account, that at that time he ſhall hear from his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. and in our ſtraits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we give God many faire words, are rhetorical more then ordinary, <hi>flatter with our lips, Pſalm</hi> 78. 36. A <hi>Scholar</hi> at the <hi>

Hence oftentimes the people of God are very <hi>fondly conceited</hi> of afflictions; and
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:170084:322"/> under deadneſſe of ſpirit, are too apt to <hi>wiſh them,</hi> out of a conceit that when they come they are able to make great <hi>uſe</hi> of them to <hi>quicken their hearts to prayer.</hi> But the Lord chaſteneth their fooliſh expectations divers times, by ſtopping their mouths under thoſe very troubles whence they hoped for great improvements and enlargements: hereby teaching them, that the Spirit of <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> as well as the Spirit of <hi>ſanctification, bloweth where and when he liſteth,</hi> John 3. 8.</p>
               <p>This caſe whenever it befalls any (as we may gheſſe when it doth ſo by our former va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of gifts, and conceits of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afflictions, &amp;c.) calls upon ſuch perſons to give God the glory of his own peculiar attribute, <hi>the preparer of the heart;</hi> and the Spirit, of its own office, <hi>the Spirit of Supplication;</hi> and call for, and rely on divine aſſiſtance meerly in that work.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes, <hi>miſapprehenſions of God,</hi> may be the cauſe of ſtraightneſſe in duty. Thoughts that God is our <hi>enemy,</hi> &amp;c. And then we deale with God as we do with our <hi>beſt friends</hi> many times in an <hi>humour;</hi> we have a conceit that they have done us a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie, or are fallen out with us, (it may be upon ſlight reports, or other as ſlender evidence) and then our ſtomacks preſently ſwell ſo bigge, that we cannot ſo much as ſpeak to them. Pride and diſcontent will ſo ſwell a mans ſtomack (like ſpleen winds)
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:170084:323"/> up to a mans mouth, that he cannot ſpeak, except to belch out the language of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and paſſion.</p>
               <p>Sometimes we conceive God ſo offended at us, that he <hi>caſts away our prayer,</hi> Lam. 3. 8. And where a man hath little <hi>hope to ſpeed,</hi> he will have very little <hi>heart to ſpeak;</hi> whereas hope to prevaile is the moſt fluent fountain of Rhetorick that can bee; thus want of <hi>Faith</hi> makes the voyce of prayer, <hi>ſtick in the teeth,</hi> as we uſe to ſay. The Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, is the Spirit of Supplication; and a man cannot pray ſo much to the purpoſe, as when he can call God <hi>Father.</hi> Then we <hi>cry,</hi> 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>cure</hi> in this caſe is. Look over all your <hi>evidences, remember dayes paſt, and the years of the right hand of the moſt high;</hi> thy <hi>ſongs in the night,</hi> and his <hi>mercy and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingkindneſſe in the day.</hi> Call to mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>everlaſting love,</hi> in, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:170084:323"/> the heavieſt afflictions; apply them and labor to urge them.

               <p>[2] After diſcovery and removal of the impediments and obſtructions aforeſaid, <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy your own caſe diſtinctly and clearly.</hi> A man that hath but <hi>confuſed notions</hi> of a thing, is not able to make a <hi>clear and diſtinct relation</hi> of it. Sometimes we cannot pray becauſe we <hi>know not</hi> what <hi>to ask, Rom.</hi> 8. 26. We know not what to ask, becauſe we know not diſtinctly what ails us; troubled we are, but we cannot tell <hi>why.</hi> As a man divers times in diſtemper of <hi>body;</hi> let a <hi>Phyſician</hi> come to him, ask him how he doth? he will tell him, <hi>Sick Sir, very ſick.</hi> But ask him, where the <hi>ſeat</hi> of his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per moſt lyes? he cannot tel, <hi>he is very ill,</hi> and that is <hi>all that he can ſay.</hi> Thus many a man is troubled <hi>in mind</hi> indiſtinctly and confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now ſuch a man cannot but be ſhut up in prayer.
